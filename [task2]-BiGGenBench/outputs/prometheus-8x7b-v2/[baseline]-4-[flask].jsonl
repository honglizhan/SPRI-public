This minor modification has the potential to significantly impact the behavior of the humanoid, as it now receives a penalty for not moving forward or not maintaining an upright position. The original reward function did not include this penalty, which could be the reason why the humanoid was not moving. This updated reward function is more aligned with the desired behavior of making the humanoid run as fast as possible, as it now rewards forward motion and penalizes deviations from being upright.
