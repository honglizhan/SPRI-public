However, there are a few inaccuracies in the usage of the tools which detract from the overall quality of the response. Firstly, the Tech Gadgets Tool is not used appropriately to find specifications and reviews for smart garden systems. The correct usage should have been `<tech_gadgets> smart garden systems <\/tech_gadgets>` instead of just `<tech_gadgets> {smart garden systems} <\/tech_gadgets>`. Secondly, the Travel Destinations Tool is not a suitable tool to learn about automated watering capabilities or the variety of plants that a system can accommodate. This tool is more suited for travel-related information, and the instruction specifically asks for information about smart garden systems. Lastly, the use of the Educational Books Tool to gather information on plant health is a good idea, but the instruction asks for a smart garden system suitable for a variety of plants, not just information on plant health.
