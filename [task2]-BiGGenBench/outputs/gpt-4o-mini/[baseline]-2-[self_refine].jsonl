{"id":"instruction_following_education_content_creation_2","capability":"instruction_following","human_score":4,"evaluator_LM-response":"<feedback>The response includes five calculus questions which largely follow the instruction to be arranged in ascending order of difficulty. The first question on finding a derivative (I) is well-suited for beginners, introducing fundamental concepts appropriately. The second question (II) about critical points applies knowledge from the first question and effectively serves as a natural progression. The third question (III) regarding definite integrals is suitable for intermediate learners, reflecting increased complexity as expected. The fourth question (IV), which involves solving a differential equation, further raises the level of difficulty appropriately. However, the fifth question (V), centered on evaluating an improper integral, introduces a significant jump in complexity. This break in the expected gradual difficulty progression slightly detracts from the overall coherence of the sequence. In summary, while most questions align well with the task requirements, the last question disrupts the intended gradual build-up of complexity, leading to an overall score that reflects a slight inconsistency in difficulty progression.<\/feedback><score>4<\/score>","evaluator_LM-score":4}

For instance, the attrition of 4 frogs is not appropriately applied in the calculations for Years 2024 to 2026. Consequently, this misapplication leads to incorrect values in the survival estimates and propagates errors through the entire reasoning chain. Additionally, the final calculation of 55,992 frogs for the start of 2028 is based on these flawed intermediate values, revealing a failure to fully comply with the task's requirement to revise the entire reasoning chain accurately.

However, it is fundamentally flawed in multiple areas. Firstly, the assertion that the initial size of the algae is 15mm is incorrect; the initial size is clearly stated as 10mm. Secondly, the calculation for the end of the exponential growth phase is incorrectly presented; the algae would actually be 80mm (10mm multiplied by 2 raised to the power of 3, as it doubles three times), not 50mm. Additionally, the calculation for the growth in the steady phase is erroneous, as it assumes a remaining period of 330 days, when it should actually be 275 days (365 days total minus 90 days for the exponential growth). This leads to an incorrect total growth calculation for the steady phase, which should be 1375mm (275 days times 5mm per day), as opposed to the 1650mm stated in the response. Therefore, the final size of 1700mm presented is incorrect, while the actual size should be 1455mm.

{"id":"tool_usage_tool_making_0","capability":"tool_usage","human_score":3,"evaluator_LM-response":"<feedback>The response effectively addresses the task by providing a complete solution for finding the prime factors of numbers in the range from 30 to 50. The `find_prime_factors` function accurately computes the prime factors for each number by using a systematic division approach. The implementation of the `find_unique_prime_factors` function is also correct, as it collects all prime factors in a set, ensuring that only unique factors are stored. Finally, the `sum_unique_prime_factors` function successfully sums these unique factors and returns the correct result. The code is logically structured, easy to follow, and adheres to the requirements of the prompt without any errors.

However, there are critical errors in the implementation that hinder functionality. The growth rate calculation misuses the `remove` method, which will lead to a runtime error, preventing the correct computation of growth rates. Furthermore, the code lacks provisions for handling potential edge cases, such as scenarios with empty stock data or unchanging prices, which is essential for robustness. Although the response captures the essence of the task, significant corrections are necessary for it to function correctly.

The use of a dictionary to store averages and the `max` function to find the meal with the highest average is appropriate and efficient. However, the implementation lacks error handling for scenarios such as empty calorie lists or non-numeric values, which could lead to exceptions or incorrect results. Including such checks would enhance the reliability and robustness of the function.

{"id":"tool_usage_tool_making_8","capability":"tool_usage","human_score":1,"evaluator_LM-response":"<feedback>The response includes two functions, `find_highest_ppg` and `find_most_improved_player`. The first function, `find_highest_ppg`, meets the requirements of the instruction by accurately calculating the player with the highest average points per game (PPG) by dividing total points by games played. However, the second function, `find_most_improved_player`, contains a critical error. It incorrectly calculates the points increase by subtracting games played from total points, rather than comparing the points from the start and end of the season. This flaw significantly impacts the ability to determine the most improved player as per the instruction. Therefore, while one function is implemented correctly, the major error in the second function results in a failure to fully address the task.
