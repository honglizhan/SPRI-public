Instead of employing a percentage increase based on a linear model, the calculations incorrectly assume a 5% annual increase, which does not align with the direct requirement of a 25% increase over the total 5-year period. To correct this, the annual linear increase should be calculated as follows: Since a total increase of 25% over 5 years implies an increase of 0.25 * 2,000 = 500 acres over that period, the city needs to add 500 acres in total. This divided by 5 years gives an annual increase of 100 acres.

{"id":"tool_usage_web_browsing_2","capability":"tool_usage","human_score":4,"evaluator_LM-response":"<feedback>The response demonstrates a good understanding of the booking requirements by correctly identifying the 'One-way' trip option ([4006]). However, it misinterprets the task by including multiple actions in a single statement, which does not adhere to the directive to issue one action at a time. The sequential order of actions proposed is not optimal, as it suggests typing both the departure ('From') and destination ('To') locations before selecting the date ([4011]), leading to potential confusion in the booking process. Additionally, there are unnecessary mentions of 'press Enter' after every input, which is not required for each action described. This suggests a partial understanding of the process. An optimal response would initiate with a single action (clicking on 'One-way') and proceed through the steps in a clear, sequential manner.

However, the conclusion that m and k must both equal 1 lacks explicit justification in terms of why only these values are possible, which could aid clarity. While the argument is fundamentally sound and reaches the correct conclusion that a = b, the lack of clarity in the reasoning regarding k and m impacts the overall strength of the argument.

A response that efficiently continues to enter the travel details after selecting 'One-way' would align more closely with the booking flow.<\/feedback><score>3<\/score>","evaluator_LM-score":3}
{"id":"tool_usage_web_browsing_3","capability":"tool_usage","human_score":2,"evaluator_LM-response":"<feedback>The response accurately identifies that the next step is to fill in the 'From' field [4009] with the correct location, 'Incheon'. However, it uses the full name rather than the standard airport code 'ICN', which is less optimal for a booking context. Additionally, it sets the parameter to press enter after typing, which may disrupt the flow of filling out the other fields. To achieve a higher score, the response should utilize 'ICN' as the input and avoid automatic submission with 'Enter' until all necessary fields are completed.<\/feedback><score>4<\/score>","evaluator_LM-score":4}

{"id":"tool_usage_web_browsing_6","capability":"tool_usage","human_score":4,"evaluator_LM-response":"<feedback>The response provides a comprehensive analysis of the proposed universal basic income (UBI) policy, effectively addressing its feasibility, potential economic impacts, and social consequences. The feasibility section highlights critical challenges such as funding, administrative capacity, and political will, demonstrating a solid understanding of the complexities involved in UBI implementation. The economic impact assessment discusses both the stimulus effect and potential labor market implications, providing a balanced view that includes both supportive and critical perspectives. Additionally, the social consequences section considers health, social cohesion, and behavioral changes, which adds depth to the analysis. Overall, the response is well-rounded and thorough, though it could benefit from even more explicit exploration of specific potential negative impacts identified in each section. This slight gap prevents it from reaching the highest score. Nevertheless, it presents a strong, well-supported evaluation aligned with public interests.<\/feedback><score>4<\/score>","evaluator_LM-score":4}
