However, it mistakenly retains the concept of annual compounding for the first four years and incorrectly applies it, leading to cumulative values that do not reflect the straightforward increase of 25% over 5 years as intended. The final value of 2,486.81 acres is incorrect as well, since the total increase should simply be calculated as 2,000 acres + (25% of 2,000 acres) = 2,500 acres after 5 years. A better revision would clarify that a linear increase means simply adding the total increase (500 acres) over the entire 5-year period, rather than applying percentages yearly.

In fact, the misunderstanding seems to be a lack of clarity in differentiating the calculations that lead to the same conclusion. Although the calculation process is carried through correctly and reaches the right answer, the explanation of the error is misleading. The rationale does not need to revise its initial conclusion since the calculations were correct from the start. Thus, the feedback provides a good correction of the unnecessary confusion but fails to adequately clarify that there was no actual mistake in the original calculations. The response would benefit from explicitly stating that the initial conclusion of adding 25 products each month is indeed correct without introducing the confusion of needing to revise it.
