However, this is misinterpreted in the following years, where it continuously states that only 12 frogs are born rather than accounting for the number of pairs formed and the reproduction process correctly. Additionally, the final total of frogs computed erroneously accumulates the new births without proper accounting for the reproduction process. The revised calculations should be accurately organized to show a consistent understanding of annual population changes, showing the correct chain of survival and reproduction, leading to the proper total at the start of 2028.

The claim that the average speed should be 200 meters per second is incorrect and misrepresents the problem's requirements. Thus, the explanation provided does not accurately dissect the rationale of the original answer, as it fails to address the linear increase in speed correctly.

As overall reasoning about the presence of competing increase and decrease rates is presented well, the answer should elaborate further on summarizing how these rates dynamically interact annually instead of notationally presenting them separately in each step.
