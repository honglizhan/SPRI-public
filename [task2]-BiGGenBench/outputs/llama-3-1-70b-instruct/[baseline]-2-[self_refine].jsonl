A more accurate approach would involve considering the actual numerical value of the prime factors, rather than solely their frequency. This critical oversight results in an incomplete and inaccurate response. To achieve full credit, the response should have accurately distinguished between the concepts of factor frequency and factor magnitude.<\/feedback><score>2<\/score>","evaluator_LM-score":2.0}
