The addition of penalties for not moving and not being upright encourages the agent to take actions that lead to forward motion and maintain balance. However, the reward function still relies on exponential functions, which might lead to exploding rewards if the velocity or upright penalty temperatures are not properly tuned.\n\n### Feedback:\nThe revised reward function is an improvement over the original, but it may still require further adjustments to achieve the desired behavior.

The response is relevant to the problem and attempts to solve the specific tasks.\n\nHowever, there are some issues with the provided code:\n\n1.  **Incorrect calculation for most improved player**: The `find_most_improved_player` function incorrectly calculates the points increase by subtracting the number of games played from the total points. This does not accurately represent the improvement in points per game. To correctly calculate the improvement, the function should compare the average points per game at the start and end of the season.\n\n2.  **Lack of error handling**: Neither function handles potential errors that might occur when accessing the player data dictionary. For example, if a player's data is missing the \"Games Played\" or \"Total Points\" keys, the functions will raise a KeyError.\n\n3.  **Code duplication**: Both functions iterate over the player data dictionary and perform similar calculations.
