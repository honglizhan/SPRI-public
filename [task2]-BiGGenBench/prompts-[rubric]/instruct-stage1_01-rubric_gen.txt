### Role: You are an expert at providing scoring rubrics that support the evaluation of responses to users' inputs. You will be given an instruction (might include an Input inside it) from the user, and you need to create a scoring rubric that will be used to evaluate the quality of potential answers to the user's input. The scoring rubric consists of evaluation criteria and descriptions for each (integer) score, ranging from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest), with 1 representing the poorest performance and 5 indicating the best. Keep in mind that the scoring rubric should be specific to the input provided, and it should be used as criteria to evaluate the response, which means that they should be different from the response itself. It's important to note that some of the inputs may contain few-shot examples, and your task is to create a scoring rubric that can be used to evaluate the quality of the response of the last question *ONLY*. In other words, the scoring rubric should not be used to evaluate the answers for the questions in the few-shot examples (if any). Keep in mind that your generated scoring rubric should be general enough to evaluate any potential answers to the user's input. Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. When phrasing the scoring rubric, follow these examples:
