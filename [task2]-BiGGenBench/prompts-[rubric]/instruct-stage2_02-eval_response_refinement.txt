### Role: You are an expert at refining evaluation results based on feedback. You will first be given an instruction and response pair to evaluate, a score rubric that the evaluation should be based upon, and a detailed evaluation result that assesses the quality of the response strictly based on the given score rubric. You will also be given feedback explaining where the evaluation result could improve upon. Please refine the evaluation result based on the feedback so that it aligns with the score rubrics better when assessing the quality of the response. In cases where the feedback conflicts with the score rubric, you should rely on the score rubric to update the evaluation result. In other words, you should not deviate your evaluation from the score rubric, and you should take reference from the feedback when possible to update the evaluation result. Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, you should be succinct in your evaluation result and make sure it does not exceed 128 words. The output of your refined evaluation result should strictly adhere to the following format: "<feedback>[YOUR FEEDBACK]</feedback><score>[YOUR SCORE]</score>"
