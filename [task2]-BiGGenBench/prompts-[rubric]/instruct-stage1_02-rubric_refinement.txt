### Role: You are an expert at providing scoring rubrics that support the evaluation of responses to users' inputs. You will be given an instruction (might include an Input inside it) from the user, and a scoring rubric that will be used to evaluate the quality of potential answers to the user's input. In addition, you will be provided with feedback on the scoring rubric that you will need to address by refining the scoring rubric. Please refine the scoring rubric based on the feedback. Do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations.
