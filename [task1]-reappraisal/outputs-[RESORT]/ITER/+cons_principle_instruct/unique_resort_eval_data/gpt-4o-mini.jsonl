I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on.

Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \\n\\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don\\'t see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.\\n\\n[Reappraisal Response] **Reappraisal Response**\\n\\nMain Factors to Consider in Mandatory Sex Education:\\n\\n1. **Inclusivity and Diversity**: Curriculum should reflect diverse sexual orientations, gender identities, and the needs of individuals with disabilities.\\n2. **Medical Accuracy**: Information must be based on reliable scientific data and health guidelines.\\n3. **Parental Involvement**: Parents should have a voice in the curriculum to ensure it aligns with community values.\\n4. **Age Appropriateness**: Content should be tailored to different age groups to ensure comprehension and relevance.\\n5. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Recognize and respect cultural differences regarding sexuality and education.\\n\\nPros of Mandatory Sex Education:\\n\\n- **Informed Decision Making**: Empowers students to make informed choices about their bodies and relationships.\\n- **Reduction in Rates of STIs and Teen Pregnancies**: Comprehensive education can lead to safer practices.\\n- **Promotion of Healthy Relationships**: Teaches respect, consent, and communication skills.\\n- **Support for LGBTQ+ Youth**: Creates an inclusive environment, reducing stigma and discrimination.\\n- **Accessibility**: Ensures that students with disabilities receive appropriate information tailored to their needs.\\n\\nCons of Mandatory Sex Education:\\n\\n- **Parental Opposition**: Some parents may disagree with the content or approach, leading to conflict.\\n- **Resource Limitations**: Schools may lack trained educators or funding to implement effective programs.\\n- **Cultural Backlash**: Potential pushback from communities with differing beliefs about sex education.\\n- **Variability in Quality**: If not standardized, educational quality may vary widely between schools.\\n\\n**Recommendations to Avoid Exploitation**:\\n\\n- **Tailored Financial Education**: Implement programs that consider the financial literacy levels of diverse populations, including those with disabilities, to prevent predatory practices.\\n- **Community Engagement**: Involve local communities in the development of financial education initiatives to ensure cultural relevance and acceptance.\\n- **Accessible Resources**: Provide clear, simple financial information to all demographic groups, focusing on preventing exploitation through knowledge.\\n- **Support Networks**: Establish support systems for individuals with lower financial acumen to help them navigate financial decisions safely.\\n\\n**Recommendations for Balancing Parenting Responsibilities**:\\n\\n- **Shared Parenting Programs**: Encourage workshops that promote shared responsibilities, addressing how both mothers and fathers can contribute equally to childcare.\\n- **Flexible Work Policies**: Advocate for workplace policies that support parents in balancing work and family responsibilities, allowing for shared time commitments.\\n- **Community Support Groups**: Create groups for parents to share strategies and experiences\\n[Feedback]  Many exceptions are included in state abortion bans. which generally fall into four categories: to prevent the death of the pregnant person, when there is risk to the health of the pregnant person, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when there is a lethal fetal anomaly.
