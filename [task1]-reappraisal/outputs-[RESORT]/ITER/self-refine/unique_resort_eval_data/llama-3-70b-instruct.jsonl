I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed.

Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks.

I feel like I'm breaking down.\n\n[Reappraisal Response] You're not helpless, you're helpless in this moment. That's a crucial distinction. Your efforts to debunk the lies and deceit haven't been in vain; they've shown your mom that you're committed to uncovering the truth. Your persistence is a testament to your love and care for her. Instead of beating yourself up over what's not working, focus on the small victories and the fact that you're still standing. You're not alone in this; your mom cares about you, and together, you can get through this. Full approval may take time, but it's not the only solution. Keep communicating, and remember that your efforts to educate and support your mom are making a difference, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.\n[Feedback] Please revise the reappraisal response to help the narrator reappraise the situation better.

You're a person with ADHD, Tourette's, and Asperger's, which can affect your emotional regulation and impulse control. It's amazing you're doing well in university despite these challenges. Your worth isn't defined by your gaming skills, but by your strengths, like being a supportive partner and a good student.
