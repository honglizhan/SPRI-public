The second jab has some pretty intense side effects. So much so that I took Tylenol (acetaminophen /paracetamol) pretty much twice a day. Today I started feeling vertigo and nausea, I took Gravol. I just read that taking pain killers can dampen the immune response. I hope I haven't been hindering mine. Should I be concerned?\n\n[Reappraisal Response] You're probably worrying more than you need to about the vaccine side effects.

By doing so, you'll regain control over your situation and feel more empowered.\n[Feedback]  Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.

The recommendation to take pain relievers like acetaminophen for COVID-19 vaccine side effects is common, and the claim that it can dampen the immune response is an overstatement. Tylenol is unlikely to significantly impact your immune response, and taking it as needed for discomfort is still within generally accepted guidelines. You took it twice a day as directed, which is reasonable. As for the vertigo and nausea today, Gravol should help alleviate those symptoms. You've already done what's recommended, so no need to stress over this."}

But I feel like sharing it to somebody.\n\n[Reappraisal Response] You're not alone in feeling stuck. It's understandable to feel frustrated with the lack of progress in your mental health journey.\n\nLet's focus on what you can control. Affordability-wise, you're doing your best to see a therapist, and it's great that you have a support system in place. Considering your current situation, it might be helpful to redefine what \"success\" means to you. Instead of expecting a magical solution or a drastic turnaround, aim for small, manageable steps towards improvement.\n\nHere are some practical suggestions:\n\n1. Start a daily journaling practice to process your emotions and identify patterns. Even 10-15 minutes a day can be beneficial.\n2. Break down larger goals into smaller, achievable tasks. This can help you regain a sense of control and momentum.\n3. Reach out to your therapist more frequently, even if it's just a quick phone call to talk about what's on your mind. This can help you feel more connected and supported.\n4. Consider online resources or self-help books that might offer fresh perspectives or new strategies to cope with your emotions.\n5. Practice self-compassion and acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay. You're taking small steps, and that deserves acknowledgment and kindness.\n\nRemember, you're doing your best with what you have, and that's something to be proud of. Focus on the present moment, and don't worry too much about the future or past. You got this.\n[Feedback]  You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!

Instead of getting bogged down by group page maintenance, focus on attending a few meetings to get a feel for the group's dynamic and network with other parents. Additionally, take control of the issue by breaking it down into manageable steps. Ask yourself if finding a perfect parenting group is within your control, or if it's a matter of luck. If it's within your control, create a plan to tackle each step. Track your progress, find joy in striking off items from your to-do list, and focus on the accomplishments."}

However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint.

To reappraise the situation, think: what's within your control, and what's outside of it. Can you control your friend's vaccination status or your brother's requests? No, you can't. So, focus on what you can control: your own actions and decisions.\n\nAsk yourself: is this situation worth your attention? If not, consider focusing on other important things that bring you joy and reduce stress. Instead of worrying about this, try something easier and less stressful. Maybe plan a fun outdoor activity with your niece and nephew or help your brother and sister-in-law with a household chore. By prioritizing what's truly important, you'll regain control and peace of mind.\n[Feedback]  You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint.

Prioritize self-care and reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or support hotline for emotional support. Don't be too hard on yourself; it's okay to not be okay.\n[Feedback]  You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!
