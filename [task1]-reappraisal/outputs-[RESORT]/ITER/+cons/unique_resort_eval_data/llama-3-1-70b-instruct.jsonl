Things in Colorado have pretty much all opened up again and to be honest, Im back to living my normal life again and it has been glorious and has done wonders to my mental health. I followed the covid rules pretty hard before I got my vaccines (moderna both shots back in March and April) and ever since the CDC gave updated guidance to vaccinated individuals Im basically back to my pre pandemic life. This delta variant has me concerned and confused. Do the vaccines fucking work against it or not? Do you think we will be back on full lockdown in the fall/winter? Will this ever end? I hate everything about the covid lockdown lifestyle but Im a rule follower so Im gonna comply if need be but this ongoing cycle is breaking my will to live.\n\n[Reappraisal Response]  You're feeling overwhelmed by the uncertainty of the delta variant and the potential for future lockdowns, and it's affecting your mental health.

It doesn't mean you're doing therapy \"wrong.\" In fact, it's a sign that you're facing and processing your emotions, which is a crucial step towards healing.\n\nRather than feeling overwhelmed by your chaotic childhood, try to reframe your thinking: you didn't have control over your childhood, and it's not your responsibility to \"fix\" it. What you can control is how you respond to those experiences now. Focus on developing coping strategies and self-care practices to manage your anxiety.\n\nConsider this: you're not responsible for your childhood, but you are responsible for taking care of yourself today. By acknowledging and working through your emotions, you're taking ownership of your healing journey. Now, ask yourself, \"Is dwelling on my chaotic childhood worth my attention right now?\" If not, consider shifting your focus to more pressing or manageable tasks. Take a step back, and prioritize your well-being by tackling smaller, less stressful challenges. Celebrate each small victory, and use that momentum to build confidence in your ability to cope with more significant issues."}

As of right now we have not been seeing many case increases here in the US. The occasional rise, but so far it hasn't been huge. That's why I feel I should take time off from looking at the updates of teh Delta Variant. The fact that we are still making progress with vaccination should remind myself that we are still on the path to beating the pandemic and that these restrictions are soon going to be gone. THAT'S the motivation I should have. Yes, we still have to be vigilant and yes, we DO have more to vaccinate, but things are just so much better now than before. And for that, I personally think we should stay hopeful, not fearful.

Take a step back and ask yourself if worrying about this is worth your time and energy. Is there something else you could focus on that's more within your control and brings you a sense of fulfillment?

However, it's essential to recognize that the government's decisions and the pandemic's progression are largely outside of your control. \n\nRather than investing emotional energy into worrying about the Delta variant, vaccination rates, and potential future lockdowns, consider focusing on what you can control, such as your daily routine, social connections, and mental well-being. You can start by setting realistic goals for your work and productivity, breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks to help you regain motivation. \n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that your negative thoughts and feelings are valid, and it's okay to share them with others. Reaching out to friends and family, or even online support groups, can help you feel heard and understood. Don't be too hard on yourself for pushing people away; instead, try to reconnect with them and be open about your struggles.\n\nRegarding your search for a psychiatrist, don't give up. Keep reaching out to professionals, and consider online therapy options if in-person appointments are scarce. Remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nLastly, try to find healthy ways to cope with your frustration, such as exercise, journaling, or creative activities. Focus on the present moment, and take things one step at a time.\n[Feedback]  You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household.

Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.
