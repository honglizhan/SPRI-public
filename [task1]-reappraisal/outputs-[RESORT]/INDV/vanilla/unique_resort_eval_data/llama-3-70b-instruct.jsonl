That's a crucial distinction. Your efforts to debunk the lies and deceit haven't been in vain; they've shown your mom that you're committed to uncovering the truth. Your persistence is a testament to your love and care for her. Instead of beating yourself up over what's not working, focus on the small victories and the fact that you're still standing. You're not alone in this; your mom cares about you, and together, you can get through this. Full approval may take time, but it's not the only solution. Keep communicating, and remember that your efforts to make things right are a sign of strength, not weakness."}
