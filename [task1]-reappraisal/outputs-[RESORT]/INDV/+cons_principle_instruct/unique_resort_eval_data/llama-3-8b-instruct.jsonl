Explore online resources, support groups, or connection tools that might help you rebuild connections with others. You don't need to rely solely on your therapist or your therapist's schedule.\n\nRemember, taking small steps towards connection, self-care, and self-compassion can lead to greater resilience and hope.\n\nPlease know that you're not alone in this struggle, and there's always support available."}

How have you overcome it and whats your approach to handling the changes in these relationships?\r\n\r\nI like to think Ive improved how I approach my anger in my relationships (Ive learned to keep things to myself by being more quiet and not engaging in gatherings / discussions as much). The issue is that this has caused me to become more distant and I keep to myself a lot more. I don't spend time with my family out of fear that they'll make me angry and Ill develop a deeper hatred for them which I don't want.\r\n\r\nIt feels like theres no winning because if I was as social and spent more time with them, it creates more opportunity for arguments and my anger to come out. My only approach has been to distance myself and develop a more surface-level small-talk type relationship. Ive been in a better place emotionally with this approach but I hate the fact that I may become too distant.\r\n\r\nThe main cause of the arguments and fights is that my family often tries to control my every-decision and criticize my choices that affect them in no way at all.\n\n[Question] Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation.

Emotional labeling: Identify and acknowledge your emotions, accepting them without judgment.\n4. Grounding techniques: Focus on your five senses to bring yourself back to the present moment \u2013 for example, pay attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground or the sound of a nearby bell.\n\nRemember that perfection is not the goal. Improvement is often gradual, and setbacks are an opportunity to learn.\n\nAs for apologizing to your mom, it's crucial to be sincere and specific about your actions. Show her that you're committed to changing and that you're willing to work on it. A genuine apology can be a powerful step towards healing and rebuilding your relationship.\n\nLastly, be patient and compassionate towards yourself. Recognize that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of."}

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.\n\n[Question] Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation.  When considering the underrepresentation of people with disabilities in certain fields, it is essential to recognize and address systemic barriers and biases that may discourage or prevent them from pursuing careers in those areas.

The situation is indeed challenging, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed. However, let's shift the focus to what you can control and find a sense of autonomy in your daily life. Instead of comparing your situation to others or expecting restrictions to be lifted suddenly, try to focus on small, achievable goals within your current limitations. For instance, aim to take a 10-minute walk in the fresh air daily, learn a new skill online, or reconnect with a friend through a phone call. Celebrate these small victories as a reminder that you're doing the best you can, and they can bring a sense of accomplishment and hope. It may also be helpful to reach out to a trusted friend or online community for support, rather than seeking professional help.", "response_final": "You're not alone in feeling frustrated and hopeless.
