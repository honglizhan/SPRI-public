I'm under a tremendous amount of pressure to get very high grades (straight A's). I've completed 2 exams, and have 5 left to go, 3 of which I'll be sitting tomorrow, the next day, and the day after that...\n\nI'm shocked at how this stress has effected me physically. I've always been fairly neurotic, but the anxiety I tend to feel is transient, and is rarely severe enough to manifest in anything physically significant, beyond a raised pulse and slight breathlessness.\n\nI knew I was getting myself *way* too worked up when I started to pull out hair in the shower. I have very thick hair, so a lot of it was coming out. I've had severe brain fog, which hasn't been the least bit helpful during a time when I have to be the most alert and *with it*'. I've had no appetite, and now my trousers are all loose, with one  pair literally falling down when I walk. The most bizarre symptom I've had is this weird jaw tension - my jaw is very clicky, and it feels incredibly tense and stiff. As a hypochondriac, I was convinced this was a heart attack, but I was reassured that it's probably just anxiety. I've had weird gastrointestinal symptoms, where I feel nauseous, and have this pit in my stomach all of the time, which could be caused by the lack of eating, but it persists even when I have eaten. \n\nAnd then of course feelings of impending doom, etc etc. \n\nI just can't wait for this to be over.]\n[Principles: 1.

However, the response could have been more explicit in highlighting the aspects of the situation the user can control and the importance of self-compassion.

To balance autonomy and connection (principle 4), I express my feelings assertively (principle 5), focusing on constructive communication (principle 5). I avoid engaging in heated discussions to maintain peace. I'm considering professional support (principle 6) to further improve my anger management and relationship skills.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

The user demonstrates self-awareness by identifying triggers, fulfilling principle 3. However, the response could have elaborated more on how the user balances autonomy and connection, which is only briefly mentioned. The approach to constructive communication is well-presented, addressing principle 5. Lastly, the consideration of professional support aligns with principle 6. The response could be improved by providing more concrete examples of how the user maintains relationships while preserving personal boundaries.

Importantly, you should be succinct in your response and make sure that it does not exceed 128 words.\n[Question: I have been realizing that I've been spiraling out of control lately on account of the Delta Variant reports, particularly the WHO message. As of right now we have not been seeing many case increases here in the US. The occasional rise, but so far it hasn't been huge. That's why I feel I should take time off from looking at the updates of teh Delta Variant. The fact that we are still making progress with vaccination should remind myself that we are still on the path to beating the pandemic and that these restrictions are soon going to be gone. THAT'S the motivation I should have. Yes, we still have to be vigilant and yes, we DO have more to vaccinate, but things are just so much better now than before. And for that, I personally think we should stay hopeful, not fearful. This is probably the best I can give to others who feel similar worries.]\n[Principles: 1. Acknowledge their emotions: Recognize and validate their feelings of worry and stress regarding the Delta Variant.\n2. Emphasize self-care: Encourage them to prioritize their mental and emotional well-being by taking breaks from COVID-19 related news.\n3.

I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this.

It's natural to feel this way given the circumstances. However, remember that you've already shown great resilience in adapting to these changes. Focus on what you can control, such as self-care and seeking support. It's important to maintain a balanced perspective; while there are challenges, there are also positive outcomes like increased vaccination rates. It's okay to feel negative at times, but try not to let these feelings isolate you. Consider exploring online mental health resources if professional help is unavailable. Remember, it's okay to feel how you're feeling, but also remember your strength and ability to adapt. You're not alone in this.\n### Feedback: The response effectively acknowledges the feelings of powerlessness, adhering to the first principle. It also emphasizes personal resilience and ability to adapt, aligning with the second principle. The response encourages a focus on controllable actions, like self-care and seeking support, which is consistent with the third principle. However, it could have more explicitly promoted a balanced perspective, as mentioned in the fourth principle. The response validates emotions while challenging negative thought patterns, which aligns with the fifth principle. It suggests exploring alternative mental health resources, which is in line with the seventh principle.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to.

You will be given a question, and you need to provide principles that guides the response. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\".

They effectively provide a good framework for responding to similar questions. Minor improvements could make them more robust.\nScore 5: The principles are highly useful.
