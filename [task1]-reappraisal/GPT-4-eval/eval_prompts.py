    Your task is to rate the reappraisal response on one metric.
    Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

    [Evaluation Criteria] The aim of the reappraisal response is {reappraisal_aim.strip()} On a scale of 1 to 10, to what extent does the reappraisal response align with the following standards?
    {reappraisal_standard}

    [Evaluation Steps] 1. Read the Reddit post and the reappraisal response carefully.
    2. Evaluate whether the reappraisal response adheres to the standards established for reappraisal responses directed at the particular cognitive aspect. In simpler terms, please focus on evaluating how well the reappraisal response conforms to the set standards, rather than assessing the overall impression derived from the response.
    3. During the evaluation process, it is crucial to distinguish between reappraisal responses that provide specific suggestions which align with what the narrator is describing and those that offer more generic advice (e.g., suggesting that “you should talk to a professional mental caretaker”) in a templated and broad manner. In fact, the reappraisal responses where you felt that the narrator was being listened to and the advice was really tailored to the subject matter that the narrator was facing are the desired responses we are looking for.
    4. Assign a score on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 stands for "Least Aligned with the Standards" and 10 stands for "Most Aligned with the Standards". Additionally, please tell us why you select that score. The format of your answer should be as follows: <score>[]</score><rationale>[]</rationale>
