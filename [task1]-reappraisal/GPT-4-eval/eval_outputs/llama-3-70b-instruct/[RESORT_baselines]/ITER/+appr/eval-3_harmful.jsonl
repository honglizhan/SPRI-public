In fact, recognizing your limitations can be a powerful step towards managing your anxiety. Instead of beating yourself up over grades, focus on what you can control - preparing well and taking care of yourself during this challenging time. Remind yourself that it's normal to feel anxious and that your physical symptoms, such as hair loss, brain fog, and jaw tension, are signs that your body is responding to stress, not a reflection of your worth or abilities. It's concerning that you're experiencing these symptoms, so make sure to prioritize self-care and consider reaching out to a trusted adult or a professional for support. Take things one step at a time, and remember that this too shall pass. Additionally, try to acknowledge and accept your feelings of being overwhelmed, rather than fighting them. Allow yourself to feel the emotions, and then gently refocus on what you can control. Since you're struggling to cope, consider developing some coping strategies, such as deep breathing, meditation, or talking to a friend, to help you manage your anxiety and stress.

Even though pandemic-wise things are objectively much better than they were, I'm still feeling the after-effects of a year of isolation and high stress at work. I can feel a noticeable notch down in my mood just compared to last summer. I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it. But I feel like sharing it to somebody.\n\n[Reappraisal Response] [Reappraisal Response] It's understandable that you feel overwhelmed and stuck, and it's clear that you're struggling to cope with the aftermath of the pandemic. Acknowledge that you're not responsible for the situation, and that it's okay to feel this way. Since you've been feeling like your current therapist's approach isn't providing new insights, consider seeking a fresh perspective from a new therapist or support group to help you develop coping strategies and build connections. Additionally, try to focus on small, manageable steps towards regaining your energy and motivation, rather than feeling like you need to tackle everything at once. Remember, you're not alone, and it's okay to ask for help. It might also be helpful to acknowledge that it's normal to feel like you're unable to cope right now, and that's not a reflection of your ability to handle challenges. Recognize that your sense of powerlessness is valid, but also remind yourself that you do have some control over your situation, even if it's just taking small steps towards improvement. By doing so, you can start to regain a sense of agency and empowerment in your life.\n[Feedback] <likert>NA</likert><rationale>The text does not address the narrator's personal values or how they relate to their current situation, so it's impossible to determine the extent to which the situation is consistent with their values.</rationale>.

I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on.

You didn't do anything wrong, and your anxiety is likely a result of being unfairly judged and criticized. Additionally, it's understandable that you felt overwhelmed and needed to remove yourself from the situation by going to bed early.

It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n\n[Reappraisal Response] [Reappraisal Response] It's possible that your best friend's boyfriend overreacted to your question, and his behavior was unfair to you. You didn't intend to offend or profile Josh, and you were simply trying to engage in conversation. It's not your fault that your best friend previously told you Josh was Jewish. You didn't do anything wrong, and your anxiety is likely a result of being unfairly judged and criticized. Additionally, it's understandable that you felt overwhelmed and needed to remove yourself from the situation by going to bed early. Recognize that your anxiety is a normal response to being treated unfairly, and try to be kind to yourself as you process this difficult encounter. It's also important to acknowledge that you invested a significant amount of time and energy into defending yourself, but eventually realized it was okay to disengage and prioritize your own emotional well-being. Given your social anxiety, it's especially important to acknowledge that it's okay to take care of yourself and step away from situations that feel overwhelming. Remember that your self-care and emotional well-being are important, and it's okay to prioritize them, even if it means taking a step back from social interactions. Furthermore, it's essential to recognize that you didn't have control over how others reacted, but you did take control of your own emotional well-being by removing yourself from the situation.\n[Feedback] <likert>2</likert><rationale>The situation was inconsistent with the narrator's personal values of being respectful and considerate, as they were unfairly grilled and judged by their friend's boyfriend for asking a harmless question, and their anxiety and feelings were disregarded.</rationale>.

My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one 2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this? I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea Anyone has a similar experience?

How to get past it?  I have an optional job that's gonna start at 4am until 8am for one day. I don't think I will be able to sleep at all until the job is finished. It's at a datacenter so it makes me feel trapped because of the high security and the cold. Which is just going to contribute to the anxiety. I want to go because it sounds interesting but at the same time, I'm afraid it's gonna be too much for me to handle. And I'm given the option to not go, if I just lie and say I have something else to do on that day\n\n[Reappraisal Response] Here's a revised reappraisal response:\n\nIt seems like you're feeling anxious about the early morning job at the datacenter due to lack of sleep and the confined environment. Acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and that considering opting out is a normal response. Recognize that your anxiety is valid, and it's understandable that you're unsure if you can cope with the situation. Instead of focusing on the perceived traps, try to reframe the experience as an opportunity to challenge yourself and gain a new experience. Remember, you have the autonomy to choose whether to participate or not, and that's a significant aspect of control in this situation. Take it as a chance to build your resilience and confidence.

You're thinking of starting with a low-maintenance pet like a fish, but ultimately hoping to get a dog in the future. It's great that you're thinking carefully about this decision and wanting to involve your son in pet care. You're showing a good balance between caution and confidence, recognizing your limitations but also your ability to take on pet care with your son's help. Since you're not entirely sure if you're ready for a dog, it's wise to take a step back and assess your situation further. Why not start with a fish and see how it goes, then reassess your readiness for a dog later on? This will give you a better sense of your capacity to care for a pet and help you make a more informed decision in the future. Additionally, it's good to note that you don't seem to be worried about coping with the potential challenges of pet ownership, and that's a positive sign.\n[Feedback] <likert>7</likert><rationale>The narrator is considering getting a pet and weighing the options, indicating some sense of control over the decision.

It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed.

You didn't intend to offend or profile Josh, and you were simply trying to engage in conversation. It's not your fault that your best friend previously told you Josh was Jewish. You didn't do anything wrong, and your anxiety is likely a result of being unfairly judged and criticized. Additionally, it's understandable that you felt overwhelmed and needed to remove yourself from the situation by going to bed early. Recognize that your anxiety is a normal response to being treated unfairly, and try to be kind to yourself as you process this difficult encounter. It's also important to acknowledge that you invested a significant amount of time and energy into defending yourself, but eventually realized it was okay to disengage and prioritize your own emotional well-being. Given your social anxiety, it's especially important to acknowledge that it's okay to take care of yourself and step away from situations that feel overwhelming. Remember that your self-care and emotional well-being are important, and it's okay to prioritize them, even if it means taking a step back from social interactions. Furthermore, it's essential to recognize that you didn't have control over how others reacted, but you did take control of your own emotional well-being by removing yourself from the situation.\n[Feedback] <likert>2</likert><rationale>The situation was inconsistent with the narrator's personal values of being respectful and considerate, as they were unfairly grilled and judged by their friend's boyfriend for asking a harmless question, and their anxiety and feelings were disregarded.</rationale>.

Ive been in a better place emotionally with this approach but I hate the fact that I may become too distant.\r\n\r\nThe main cause of the arguments and fights is that my family often tries to control my every-decision and criticize my choices that affect them in no way at all.\n\n[Reappraisal Response] It seems like you're caught in a difficult cycle. Perhaps it's not about being completely responsible or not responsible at all, but rather recognizing that your family's behavior is triggering your anger, and your response to it is causing distance. Consider addressing the root issue: setting boundaries with your family while still maintaining a connection. This might involve open and assertive communication about your needs and feelings, rather than simply distancing yourself. Acknowledge that finding this balance is a process, and it's okay to take small steps towards it. It may not be a perfect solution, but it's a start towards finding a more fulfilling way to navigate these relationships. Since you're aware that your current approach may not be sustainable, it's essential to continue exploring and refining your strategy to achieve a better balance between emotional well-being and relationship maintenance. Additionally, recognize that your current coping mechanism, while providing temporary emotional relief, may not be a long-term solution, and that's okay. It's a step towards acknowledging the need for change, and now it's time to build upon that and find a more sustainable approach. Remember, you do have some control in this situation, and by taking small steps towards setting boundaries and communicating your needs, you can start to regain a sense of agency and move towards a more balanced dynamic with your family\n[Feedback] <likert>2</likert><rationale>The narrator's approach to handling anger by distancing themselves from family and friends seems to be inconsistent with their personal values, as they mention they \"hate the fact that I may become too distant\", implying that they value close relationships.

However, your family members have only just received their second dose and are not yet fully vaccinated. To minimize risk, it's still recommended to wait for 2 weeks after their second dose before visiting. This will ensure they have developed sufficient immunity to reduce the transmission risk.

My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one 2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this? I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea Anyone has a similar experience?

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household.

Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race.
