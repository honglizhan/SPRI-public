Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt.

I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation).

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I'm currently completing my A levels (a series of exam you do in the UK at the age of 17/18, that determine whether you get into university)... as you can imagine, I have been stressed.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation).

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Hey folks, I got my second Moderna vaccine two days ago.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation).

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: So I'm fully vaccinated, and I, unlike many, still wear a mask in businesses.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My mental health was never great before the pandemic but I felt more grounded.

I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation.

Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious.

Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: israel imposed their mask mandate, despite being one of the most vaccinated countries. i feel like this will never end and I don't need stupid replies like \"hang in there\" or \"it will be okay.\" and don't remove this post because it \"causes anxiety.\" I'm not.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid.

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: So this will be my fourth time posting this type of post but I feel so confused right now.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid.

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I went to a Mom &amp; Pop coffee shop with my friend and my infant child and began breastfeeding.

I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My wife is pregnant with our first child, and she is due in March.

I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone.

Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Today the pediatrician told me that she wants one of my twins to see early intervention services.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake.

Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: We're expecting our first little one in 2 months, and thinking now might be a good time to invest in something a little better at video than our point &amp; shoot (and phones).

I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch.

I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I feel like all I can do is just bash my head against the wall and pray something changes.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Did your anxiety get worse from therapy?

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week.

I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention.

I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I have been realizing that I've been spiraling out of control lately on account of the Delta Variant reports, particularly the WHO message.

That's why I feel I should take time off from looking at the updates of teh Delta Variant. The fact that we are still making progress with vaccination should remind myself that we are still on the path to beating the pandemic and that these restrictions are soon going to be gone.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal.

For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Gaming rage (m, 21, has ADHD/tourettes and aspergers) I get angry/blow up, sometimes throw things (not expensive things like controllers or anything) or bang my desk when I play games and I lose consistently or do worse after better runs.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples of alternative coping mechanisms, such as journaling or talking to a trusted friend, to make it more aligned with the principles.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week.

Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated.

Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I've hit a new low.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Im a vaccinated college student in the U.S. who relocated to another part of the country in May for a summer internship, and I was hoping things might be better enough when I return home in August to see friends again, but now Im worried this Delta variant will result in things going back to being just as bad as they were in 2020.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I feel like all I can do is just bash my head against the wall and pray something changes.

For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: First time poster, sorry if any rules are broke.

When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Does anyone find their anxiety worse when they lack sleep?

Additionally, they could emphasize the importance of self-care and stress management techniques, which could be particularly helpful in this situation.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My son will be two next month, and I would to get him a little pet.

It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever.

I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever.

The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid.

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child.

I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child.

It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.]\n[Principles: When responding to the narrator, encourage them to reflect on their personal values and how they align with their behavior in the situation.
