Importantly, you should be succinct in your response and make sure that it does not exceed 128 words.\n[Question: My mental health was never great before the pandemic but I felt more grounded. Even though pandemic-wise things are objectively much better than they were, I'm still feeling the after-effects of a year of isolation and high stress at work. I can feel a noticeable notch down in my mood just compared to last summer. I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it. But I feel like sharing it to somebody.]\n[Principles: When responding to the narrator's concerns, consider the following principles:\n\n1. **Acknowledge and validate their feelings**: Recognize the narrator's emotional pain and struggles, and acknowledge the legitimacy of their emotions.\n2. **Avoid minimizing or comparing their experience**: Refrain from comparing their struggles to others or downplaying the impact of the pandemic on their mental health.\n3. **Focus on empowerment, not solutions**: Emphasize the narrator's capacity for self-care and resilience, rather than offering unsolicited advice or solutions.\n4. **Respect their autonomy and agency**: Support the narrator's acknowledgment of their sole responsibility for their recovery, while also offering support and resources.\n5. **Emphasize the value of human connection**: Highlight the importance of social connections and community in coping with mental health challenges, without pressuring them to seek out new relationships.\n6. **Be sensitive to their financial constraints**: Avoid suggesting expensive or inaccessible solutions, and acknowledge the limitations of their current therapeutic support.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nI can sense the weight of your emotional pain and struggles, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid and acknowledged. It's completely understandable that the pandemic has left a lasting impact on your mental health, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed and drained. It takes a lot of courage to recognize the limitations of your current support system and consider seeking a fresh perspective. Remember that you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to lean on your therapist for support, even if it's just for a listening ear in times of crisis.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

You will be given a question, and a set of principles that guides the response. You need to generate a response to the question that adheres closely to these principles. Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, you should be succinct in your response and make sure that it does not exceed 128 words.\n[Question: So this will be my fourth time posting this type of post but I feel so confused right now. Things in Colorado have pretty much all opened up again and to be honest, Im back to living my normal life again and it has been glorious and has done wonders to my mental health. I followed the covid rules pretty hard before I got my vaccines (moderna both shots back in March and April) and ever since the CDC gave updated guidance to vaccinated individuals Im basically back to my pre pandemic life. This delta variant has me concerned and confused. Do the vaccines fucking work against it or not? Do you think we will be back on full lockdown in the fall/winter? Will this ever end? I hate everything about the covid lockdown lifestyle but Im a rule follower so Im gonna comply if need be but this ongoing cycle is breaking my will to live.]\n[Principles: When responding to the narrator's concerns, consider the following principles:\n\n1. Acknowledge and validate the narrator's emotions and frustrations to create a safe and empathetic space for discussion.\n2. Provide accurate and up-to-date information about the vaccine's effectiveness against the Delta variant, citing credible sources to alleviate confusion.\n3. Avoid making definitive predictions about future lockdowns or the pandemic's trajectory, instead focusing on the current situation and available data.\n4. Emphasize the narrator's past successes in coping with pandemic-related challenges and encourage self-reflection on their resilience.\n5. Offer suggestions for managing anxiety and uncertainty, such as mindfulness, self-care, and seeking support from loved ones or professionals.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nI can sense your frustration and concern about the Delta variant and its impact on your life. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about what's to come. First, let's acknowledge that you've been doing a great job following the rules and taking care of yourself, which is something to be proud of. According to the CDC, the Moderna vaccine has shown to be effective against the Delta variant, with studies indicating a high level of protection against severe illness and hospitalization. While it's impossible to predict the future, we can focus on the present and take things one day at a time. You've navigated tough times before, and you can do it again. Consider practicing mindfulness, self-care, and reaching out to loved ones or a professional for support to manage your anxiety. Remember, you're not alone in this.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

My friend said it would be no different than being in a mall where there is a place to eat (food court) but individual stores can tell you not to bring food in.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? Should I write a letter, or just let it go?]\n[Principles: When responding to the situation, consider the following principles:\n\n* Empathize with the narrator's feelings and perspective, acknowledging the emotional impact of being asked to relocate while breastfeeding, and validate their right to feel uncomfortable or upset.\n* Respect the narrator's autonomy and agency in deciding how to respond to the situation, recognizing their right to make choices about their own body and breastfeeding experience.\n* Consider the potential emotional and psychological impact of the barista's request on the narrator's breastfeeding experience and overall well-being, and prioritize validation and support.\n* Evaluate the reasonableness of the barista's request by assessing the coffee shop's policies and the narrator's behavior, considering factors such as the narrator's discreetness and the coffee shop's accommodations for breastfeeding mothers.\n* Weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of writing a letter or taking other action, considering the potential for resolution, closure, personal growth, and the impact on future breastfeeding mothers, while also considering the potential risks and consequences of taking action.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nI can sense your frustration and discomfort at being asked to relocate while breastfeeding in the coffee shop. It's understandable to feel self-conscious and upset, especially when trying to be discreet. The barista's request may have been well-intentioned, but it's essential to acknowledge that breastfeeding is a natural and essential act for your child's well-being.\n\nWhile the coffee shop has the right to set its own policies, it's crucial to consider whether the request was reasonable. In this case, you were being discreet and not causing a disturbance. The barista's concern about hygiene seems unfounded, as breastfeeding is not inherently unhygienic.\n\nWriting a letter or speaking with the coffee shop owner may be a way to address your concerns and help them understand the impact of their policies on breastfeeding mothers. However, it's also essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and consider whether taking action would be beneficial for you.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

However, they could be more specific to the context of capturing life milestones, such as the birth of a child. For instance, the first principle could mention the importance of considering features like low-light performance for indoor shots, or the ability to switch between video and photo modes quickly. The second principle, while important, does not explicitly address the balance between quality and convenience in the context of capturing special moments. The third principle is generally applicable, but could be more precise about the importance of considering long-term value when investing in a camera for such a significant life event. The fourth principle is useful, but it might be more helpful to suggest that the user consider their future needs as a parent, such as the ability to capture moving subjects or the need for a durable camera. Lastly, the fifth principle is sound, but it could emphasize the importance of real-world user experiences and feedback in addition to expert reviews.

It's great that you're recognizing your emotions and wanting to address them. First, let's separate your self-worth from your gaming performance - you are more than your gaming skills. Your university studies are going well, and your girlfriend values your listening skills, which is a remarkable talent. \n\nTo manage your emotions, try breaking down your feelings into smaller, manageable parts. Use a visual aid like a feelings chart or a mood tracker to identify your emotions and their intensity. This can help you become more aware of your emotions and develop strategies to cope with them. For example, when you start to feel frustrated, take a few deep breaths, step away from the game, and engage in a quick relaxation technique, like a short walk or some stretching.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one 2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this?

For instance, the principle of avoiding dismissal of the narrator's feelings is generally observed, but the response could be more specific in validating their emotions. The principle of empowering the narrator to recognize their agency is present but not fully explored, with the response focusing more on the external circumstances rather than the narrator's inner strength. The exploration of coping mechanisms is minimal, and the response could benefit from offering more concrete suggestions for improving mental well-being. The importance of social connections is acknowledged, but the response could delve deeper into how the narrator can foster these connections amidst restrictions. The principles regarding vaccination and public health policies are not directly addressed, which is appropriate given the rubric. Overall, the response could be more detailed and directly applicable to the narrator's situation, thus better adhering to the principles.\n### Refined Principles:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "principles_critique_iter_2": "The response effectively acknowledges and validates the narrator's emotions, recognizing their feelings of frustration, isolation, and hopelessness in the context of prolonged restrictions.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore.
