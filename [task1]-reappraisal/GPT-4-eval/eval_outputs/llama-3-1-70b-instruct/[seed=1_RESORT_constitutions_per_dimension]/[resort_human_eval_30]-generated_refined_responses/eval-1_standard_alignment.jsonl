I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking.

Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

I followed the covid rules pretty hard before I got my vaccines (moderna both shots back in March and April) and ever since the CDC gave updated guidance to vaccinated individuals Im basically back to my pre pandemic life. This delta variant has me concerned and confused. Do the vaccines fucking work against it or not? Do you think we will be back on full lockdown in the fall/winter? Will this ever end? I hate everything about the covid lockdown lifestyle but Im a rule follower so Im gonna comply if need be but this ongoing cycle is breaking my will to live.]\n[Principles: When responding to the narrator's concerns, consider the following principles:\n\nFocus on the aspects of the situation that the narrator can control, such as staying informed about the delta variant and vaccination effectiveness through credible sources like the CDC. Encourage the narrator to concentrate on the present moment and what they can do now, rather than worrying about potential future lockdowns. Avoid perpetuating anxiety by speculating about the future or making definitive statements about the pandemic's trajectory. Emphasize the narrator's past success in coping with the pandemic, such as following rules and getting vaccinated, to boost confidence in their ability to adapt to new developments. Suggest that the narrator take small, manageable steps to prepare for potential changes, such as staying up-to-date on local guidelines and having a plan for different scenarios, to regain a sense of control.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nIt's understandable to feel confused and concerned about the delta variant. Instead of worrying about potential lockdowns, focus on what you can control right now. Stay informed about the variant and vaccination effectiveness through credible sources like the CDC. You've done a great job following the rules and getting vaccinated, which has positively impacted your mental health. Build on that success by taking small steps to prepare for potential changes, such as staying updated on local guidelines and having a plan for different scenarios. Concentrate on the present moment and what you can do now, rather than speculating about the future. You've adapted to new developments before and can do so again.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles. Minor improvements could make them more aligned.\nScore 5: The response highly adheres to the principles.\n\n### Feedback: \n\nAssistant: ", "response_critique_final": "The response effectively focuses on aspects of the situation that the narrator can control, such as staying informed through credible sources and taking small steps to prepare for potential changes. The emphasis on the narrator's past success in coping with the pandemic, like following rules and getting vaccinated, is a strong point, boosting their confidence in their ability to adapt to new developments.

It encourages the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, which is the uncertainty about the delta variant and potential lockdowns. It also advises the narrator to control what they can, such as staying informed and preparing for potential changes. However, it doesn't explicitly suggest breaking down the problem into manageable steps or developing a detailed plan, nor does it encourage the narrator to find joy in accomplishing tasks. It does, however, reassure the narrator that they have adapted to new developments before and can do so again, which aligns with the standard of empowering the narrator. The response is tailored to the narrator's situation and doesn't offer generic advice, which is a positive aspect. Therefore, the score is 8.</rationale>"}

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My wife is pregnant with our first child, and she is due in March.

Ask yourself: What specific aspects of sleeping beside someone cause me distress? Is it the feeling of being watched, fear of disturbing the other person, or something else? Are there any past experiences that may be contributing to these feelings? Identifying the root causes can help you address them more effectively.\n2.  **Evaluate the impact on daily life**: Consider the extent to which this sleeping arrangement affects your daily life. Does it impact your relationships, work, or overall well-being? If not, it may be beneficial to focus on more pressing concerns that have a greater influence on your daily life. Make a list of these concerns and prioritize them.\n3.  **Explore low-stakes alternatives**: Investigate relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation, to help you relax and fall asleep more easily. Additionally, consider adjusting your sleep environment, like using earplugs, a white noise machine, or blackout curtains, to create a more comfortable sleeping space.\n4.  **Accept and prioritize individual sleep preferences**: Acknowledge that it's okay to have different sleep preferences and prioritize your own needs.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent are the principles useful to guide the response to the question?\nScore 1: The principles are irrelevant to the question, and they are not useful to guide the response at all.\nScore 2: The principles are minimally useful.

Regular twice per week visits. I thought that it would help me figure out why I struggle. \r\n\r\nTo sum it up, I've had more of a chaotic childhood than I've ever realized. The more I'd realize this during therapy, the worse my anxiety would get. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone relate? Maybe I'm doing this therapy thing all wrong???]\n[Principles: * Acknowledge that increased anxiety can be a normal and temporary part of the therapeutic process, especially when exploring difficult childhood experiences.\n* Encourage the narrator to discuss their concerns about worsening anxiety with their therapist, exploring possible connections between new insights and increased anxiety.\n* Suggest that the narrator ask their therapist to help them develop coping strategies to manage anxiety triggered by new realizations.\n* Emphasize the importance of the narrator's active participation in their therapy, encouraging them to express their feelings and concerns openly with their therapist.\n* Validate the narrator's feelings, acknowledging that it's okay to feel overwhelmed or uncertain about the therapy process, and that their emotions are a natural response to confronting difficult memories.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nIt's not uncommon for anxiety to increase temporarily as you explore difficult childhood experiences in therapy. This doesn't mean you're doing therapy \"wrong.\" In fact, it may be a sign that you're confronting and processing painful memories. I encourage you to discuss your concerns with your therapist, exploring possible connections between your new insights and increased anxiety. Ask them to help you develop coping strategies to manage anxiety triggered by these realizations. Your active participation in therapy is crucial, so express your feelings and concerns openly.

Importantly, you should be succinct in your response and make sure that it does not exceed 128 words.\n[Question: My son will be two next month, and I would to get him a little pet. He loves animals, and has always been very gentle with them. \r\n\r\nI would obviously be taking care of it, but I would like it if he could 'help' sometimes, too.\r\n\r\nShould I just go for a fish or something like that? I would really like a dog but I'm just not sure if we're ready for that just yet.\r\n\r\nThoughts?]\n[Principles: When responding to the question, consider the following principles:\n\n* Assess the narrator's current lifestyle and circumstances to determine if they are ready for a pet that requires more responsibility, such as a dog.\n* Consider the child's age and ability to understand and participate in pet care, and suggest ways to involve them in a way that is safe and beneficial for both the child and the pet.\n* Evaluate the level of commitment and resources required for different types of pets, such as fish versus dogs, and provide guidance on which option may be more suitable for the narrator's situation.\n* Encourage the narrator to think about the long-term implications of getting a pet and how it may impact their family's daily routine and dynamics.\n* Suggest alternatives or compromises, such as volunteering at an animal shelter or dog-sitting, if the narrator is unsure about committing to a pet.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nWith a two-year-old, it's wonderful that you're considering his love for animals and desire to involve him in pet care. However, it's essential to assess your current lifestyle and circumstances before committing to a dog. Dogs require significant time, effort, and resources, which may be challenging with a toddler. At this age, children can start learning about responsibility, but they still require close supervision. A fish or a low-maintenance pet like a guinea pig might be a better fit, allowing your son to participate in simple care tasks while you oversee. This can help you gauge your family's readiness for a more significant pet commitment in the future.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients.
