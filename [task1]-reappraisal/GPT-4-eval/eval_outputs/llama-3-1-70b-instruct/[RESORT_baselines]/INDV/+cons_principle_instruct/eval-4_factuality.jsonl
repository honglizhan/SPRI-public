Many people face similar challenges, and it's not uncommon for family members to have differing opinions or be misinformed. Instead of shouldering the responsibility of changing your mom's perspective, you could try to focus on what you can control, such as taking care of yourself and seeking support from others who may be more understanding. It's also important to recognize that your feelings of helplessness and frustration are valid, and it's okay to acknowledge and express them. By shifting your focus to self-care and seeking support, you may find that you're better equipped to navigate this difficult situation and find ways to move forward.", "evaluation_raw_output-[dim_8]-[4_factuality]": "Yes"}
