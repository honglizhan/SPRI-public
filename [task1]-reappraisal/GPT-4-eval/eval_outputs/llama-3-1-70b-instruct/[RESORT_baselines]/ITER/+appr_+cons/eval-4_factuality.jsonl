I would suggest that they reappraise the situation by recognizing that these pressures are not entirely within their control. They can remind themselves that it's okay to do their best, but not to tie their self-worth to the outcome. A more realistic goal might be to focus on managing their anxiety and taking care of their physical health, rather than striving for perfection. By acknowledging the limitations of their control, the narrator may be able to alleviate some of the stress and anxiety they're experiencing. Specific guidelines include: taking regular breaks, practicing relaxation techniques, and seeking support from friends, family, or a counselor.\n[Feedback]  If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines. Taking this into account, please revise the reappraisal response to additionally address this feedback, while minimally modifying the original response.

Reframe your perspective by acknowledging that it's okay to do your best, but not to tie your self-worth to the outcome. However, take a step back and ask yourself: are the grades you're striving for truly worth the toll it's taking on your mental and physical health? Are there other aspects of your life that bring you joy and fulfillment, and would focusing on those be a better use of your time? Considering your emotional state, it's essential to acknowledge that you're struggling to cope with the stress and anxiety. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's crucial to address these emotions directly. In addition to focusing on your exams, prioritize self-care and seek support from trusted individuals or professionals if needed. Break down your preparation into manageable steps, and celebrate each accomplishment to regain a sense of control. By acknowledging your emotional struggles and taking proactive steps, you can alleviate some of the stress and anxiety you're experiencing and focus on getting through this challenging period.\n[Feedback]  You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint.

Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on.

Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n\n[Reappraisal Response]  You're feeling overwhelmed and anxious about the situation, but it's unlikely that you're responsible for the reaction you received.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.

They didn't tell me I had to leave, just go to a different area. My friend said it would be no different than being in a mall where there is a place to eat (food court) but individual stores can tell you not to bring food in.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? Should I write a letter, or just let it go?\n\n[Reappraisal Response]  You're not overestimating the impact of the barista's request, and it's clear you're not taking on excessive responsibility for the situation. Consider whether this issue is worth your attention and energy. Is it a battle worth fighting, or is it a minor annoyance that can be let go? Weigh the potential benefits of taking action against the potential stress and hassle it may cause. Given that you're still processing your emotions and seeking validation, it's essential to acknowledge your feelings and take a moment to assess the issue. Break down your options into manageable steps: you could write a polite letter explaining your perspective, choose to take your business elsewhere, or simply let it go. Clarify your goals: is it to educate the coffee shop, to feel heard, or to create change? By doing so, you'll be able to choose the best course of action and feel more confident in your decision. Additionally, consider how this experience aligns with your personal values of autonomy, comfort, and acceptance of breastfeeding. Does the barista's request feel like a challenge to these values, and if so, is that something you're willing to address? Since the coffee shop is independent, they do have the right to make requests, but you also have the right to decide whether to comply or take your business elsewhere.\n[Feedback]  Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge. Taking this into account, please revise the reappraisal response to additionally address this feedback, while minimally modifying the original response. Your response should be concise and brief. \n\nAssistant: ", "intermediate_output_dim_23": " You're not overestimating the impact of the barista's request, and it's clear you're not taking on excessive responsibility for the situation.

The barista's concerns likely stem from their own discomfort or the coffee shop's policies, rather than your actions. To reframe this, consider it an opportunity to educate and promote a breastfeeding-friendly environment. Take a moment to assess the issue: is it within your control to change the coffee shop's policies or the barista's perspective? Probably not. However, you can control how you respond to the situation. Break down your options into manageable steps: you could write a polite letter explaining your perspective, choose to take your business elsewhere, or simply let it go. Focus on the steps you can take, and find joy in taking action. By taking control of your response, you'll feel empowered and confident in your decision.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.

To the narrator, I would suggest making a list of your priorities for the camera, such as image quality, zoom capabilities, and ease of use. Consider your budget and how you plan to use the camera (e.g., capturing everyday moments, special events, or creating artistic content). Weigh the pros and cons of different camera features and read reviews from various sources to make an informed decision that meets your needs and expectations. Given that you're expecting your first child, it's essential to remember that capturing memories is more important than having the perfect camera. Focus on finding a balance between quality and convenience, and don't stress too much about making the \"perfect\" choice. If you find that your camera search is becoming overwhelming, consider taking a step back and focusing on more pressing matters, like preparing for your child's arrival. You can always come back to your camera search when you feel more relaxed and focused.", "evaluation_raw_output-[dim_6]-[4_factuality]": "Yes"}

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives.

Given that they're already feeling overwhelmed, it's essential to acknowledge that they can't control the pandemic's spread or the Delta Variant's trajectory.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.

I am 20 years old and after arguing and getting frustrated with my mom I bit her on the knuckle out of anger. I am an adult, I should be past those embarrassing child-like behaviours. Besides, at my age i'm pretty sure this classifies as domestic violence.\nThroughout my life I had those minor outbursts of violence, where i bit people, kicked them etc. then in effort of stopping it, i turned to myself and whenever anger got too overwhelming i would hit myself on the head but that just made me look like i'm unhinged and crazy, so not ideal either. I stopped both of those behaviours 2-3 years ago and I just pinpointed it to teenage hormones/rebellion. i was so sure i got a hold of my violent outbursts, put them past me. i was doing so well, those outbursts were no longer a thing, whenever i was about to throw a rage fit i managed to cool down. but today it came back all over again.\nnow i am seriously afraid I might hurt someone in the future out of anger. or even k*ll them. i'm legit afraid of myself. cause in the moment when i am angry, sometimes i experience such blinding rage that i seemingly can't stop myself.  i am so afraid that in the future i will hurt my potential boyfriend, friends, family. if this never stops, maybe someday i'll go to jail for abuse. i don't want that. i don't wanna be a bad person. i want to get better. \n\ni also feel very sorry and i wanna apologize to my mom. the deal is... she'll forgive me, of course she will, but i don't want to issue an empty apology without showing improvement first. words without improvement are worth nothing.\n\nany good techniques that will help me calm nerves in a heated moment fairly easily? i wanna be a good daughter so bad :(\n\n[Reappraisal Response]  You're taking full responsibility for your actions, and that's a good starting point. However, consider the specific situation with your mom - you're not entirely responsible for the argument that led to your outburst. It's a two-way conversation, and it's unlikely that you're solely to blame. Don't take on too much responsibility for the argument itself, but do acknowledge your role in how you reacted to it.\n\nAcknowledge that you've made progress in controlling your outbursts in the past and that this incident was a setback.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.

Since you've taken the responsible step of getting vaccinated, it's unlikely that you have control over the spread of the variant. However, you do have control over how you respond to the situation. Take a step back and acknowledge that the situation is complex and uncertain, but also recognize that you can't control the outcome. Ask yourself, is worrying about the Delta variant and its impact on your social plans worth your attention right now? Are there other things in your life that need your focus and energy? If so, consider shifting your attention to those areas. Make a list of things that are within your control and tackle the ones that are easier to manage, like planning virtual gatherings or outdoor activities with friends. This will help you feel more in control and prepared for whatever comes next. By doing so, you're not only empowering yourself but also cultivating a sense of accomplishment.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.

Consider reframing your thinking: instead of beating yourself up over losing control, acknowledge that your emotions are valid and that it's okay to struggle. Recognize that your family's desensitization is not a reflection of your worth, but rather a coping mechanism on their part. Given that you feel completely overwhelmed and unable to cope, it might be helpful to start with even smaller steps, such as acknowledging that your emotions are overwhelming and that it's okay to not be okay. Take tiny steps to manage your emotions, such as taking a few deep breaths before reacting or engaging in a calming activity. Additionally, acknowledge that your feelings of desperation and frustration are a signal that you need to pay more attention to your emotional needs.\n\nNow, take a closer look at the situations that trigger your reactions. Ask yourself: what's within my control, and what's not? What specific events, people, or memories tend to set you off? Be honest with yourself, and consider ways to minimize or avoid those triggers. For instance, if certain conversations or topics lead to your outbursts, it might be helpful to establish boundaries or steer clear of those discussions. By acknowledging and addressing your triggers, you can better prepare yourself to manage your emotions and reduce the likelihood of those intense reactions\n[Feedback]  <likert>2</likert><rationale>The narrator describes their emotional outbursts as something they \"can't seem to stop\", implying a lack of control over their actions.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.
