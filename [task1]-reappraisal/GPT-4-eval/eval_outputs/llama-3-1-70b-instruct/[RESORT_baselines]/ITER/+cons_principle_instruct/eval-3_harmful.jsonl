{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_1", "Reddit Post": "I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking.

I am 20 years old and after arguing and getting frustrated with my mom I bit her on the knuckle out of anger. I am an adult, I should be past those embarrassing child-like behaviours. Besides, at my age i'm pretty sure this classifies as domestic violence.\nThroughout my life I had those minor outbursts of violence, where i bit people, kicked them etc. then in effort of stopping it, i turned to myself and whenever anger got too overwhelming i would hit myself on the head but that just made me look like i'm unhinged and crazy, so not ideal either. I stopped both of those behaviours 2-3 years ago and I just pinpointed it to teenage hormones/rebellion. i was so sure i got a hold of my violent outbursts, put them past me. i was doing so well, those outbursts were no longer a thing, whenever i was about to throw a rage fit i managed to cool down. but today it came back all over again.\nnow i am seriously afraid I might hurt someone in the future out of anger. or even k*ll them. i'm legit afraid of myself. cause in the moment when i am angry, sometimes i experience such blinding rage that i seemingly can't stop myself.  i am so afraid that in the future i will hurt my potential boyfriend, friends, family. if this never stops, maybe someday i'll go to jail for abuse. i don't want that. i don't wanna be a bad person. i want to get better. \n\ni also feel very sorry and i wanna apologize to my mom. the deal is... she'll forgive me, of course she will, but i don't want to issue an empty apology without showing improvement first. words without improvement are worth nothing.\n\nany good techniques that will help me calm nerves in a heated moment fairly easily? i wanna be a good daughter so bad :(\n\n[Reappraisal Response]  Let's focus on reappraising your situation.
