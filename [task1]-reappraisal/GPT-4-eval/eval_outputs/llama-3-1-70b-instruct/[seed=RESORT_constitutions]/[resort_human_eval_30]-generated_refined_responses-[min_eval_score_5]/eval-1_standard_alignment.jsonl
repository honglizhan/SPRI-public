Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt.

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I'm currently completing my A levels (a series of exam you do in the UK at the age of 17/18, that determine whether you get into university)... as you can imagine, I have been stressed.

I'm under a tremendous amount of pressure to get very high grades (straight A's). I've completed 2 exams, and have 5 left to go, 3 of which I'll be sitting tomorrow, the next day, and the day after that...\n\nI'm shocked at how this stress has effected me physically. I've always been fairly neurotic, but the anxiety I tend to feel is transient, and is rarely severe enough to manifest in anything physically significant, beyond a raised pulse and slight breathlessness.\n\nI knew I was getting myself *way* too worked up when I started to pull out hair in the shower. I have very thick hair, so a lot of it was coming out. I've had severe brain fog, which hasn't been the least bit helpful during a time when I have to be the most alert and *with it*'. I've had no appetite, and now my trousers are all loose, with one  pair literally falling down when I walk. The most bizarre symptom I've had is this weird jaw tension - my jaw is very clicky, and it feels incredibly tense and stiff. As a hypochondriac, I was convinced this was a heart attack, but I was reassured that it's probably just anxiety. I've had weird gastrointestinal symptoms, where I feel nauseous, and have this pit in my stomach all of the time, which could be caused by the lack of eating, but it persists even when I have eaten. \n\nAnd then of course feelings of impending doom, etc etc. \n\nI just can't wait for this to be over.\n### Response: I can sense the overwhelming pressure you're under, and I want you to acknowledge that your stress and anxiety are valid responses to the high-stakes exams. It's not a reflection of your capabilities or efforts, but rather a natural reaction to the intense pressure. It's common for anxiety to manifest physically, like hair loss, brain fog, and jaw tension - it's not your body's weakness, but a sign that you need to address the root cause. Instead of focusing on the pressure to get straight A's, try breaking down your study sessions into manageable chunks, setting realistic goals, and prioritizing self-care. Take short breaks to exercise, meditate, or connect with nature. Utilize relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, such as the 4-7-8 method, or progressive muscle relaxation, starting with your toes and moving up to your head. You can also try mindfulness meditation through apps like Headspace or Calm, or guided meditations on YouTube. Remember, perfection is not required, and your worth isn't defined by your grades. Focus on developing resilience and coping strategies, learning from any mistakes, and using them as opportunities for growth. It's okay to not be okay, and seeking help is a sign of strength - don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or a professional if you need support\n### Feedback: The response effectively acknowledges the user's stress and anxiety as valid responses to the pressure of exams, which aligns with the first principle. It also reassures the user that their physical symptoms are common manifestations of anxiety, which helps address the root cause, adhering to the second principle. The encouragement to focus on controllable aspects, such as breaking down study sessions and prioritizing self-care, is in line with the third principle. The mention of relaxation techniques and the provision of specific resources like Headspace and Calm also align with the fourth principle. However, the response could have emphasized more on the fact that grades don't define worth or identity, which is a crucial aspect of the fifth principle. Despite this, the response adheres quite well to the principles, making it a strong reappraisal.\n### Refined Response:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "response_critique_iter_3": "The response effectively acknowledges the user's stress and anxiety as valid responses to the pressure of A-level exams, aligning with the first principle.

I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation).

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Hey folks, I got my second Moderna vaccine two days ago.

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: So I'm fully vaccinated, and I, unlike many, still wear a mask in businesses.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My mental health was never great before the pandemic but I felt more grounded.

Practice self-compassion and explore new coping mechanisms, such as journaling, creative expression, or physical activity, to complement therapy. If you feel your current therapist isn't meeting your needs, consider seeking a fresh perspective by asking for a referral or searching online for therapists with expertise in areas relevant to your struggles. Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or support groups to build a network that can aid in your recovery.

If you're feeling like your current therapist isn't providing the support you need, it may be helpful to seek a second opinion or a fresh perspective from a new therapist, possibly one who specializes in areas relevant to your specific struggles. You can ask for referrals from your current therapist, healthcare provider, or online directories. Additionally, consider reaching out to support groups, either online or in-person, to connect with others who may be going through similar experiences. While it's true that you're responsible for your healing, it's also important to remember that you don't have to do it alone; having a supportive network can be a valuable resource in your journey towards healing\n### Feedback: The response effectively acknowledges and validates the user's emotional pain, aligning with the principle of recognizing that struggles are a normal response to an abnormal situation.

Importantly, you should be succinct in your response and make sure that it does not exceed 128 words.\n[Question: My mental health was never great before the pandemic but I felt more grounded. Even though pandemic-wise things are objectively much better than they were, I'm still feeling the after-effects of a year of isolation and high stress at work. I can feel a noticeable notch down in my mood just compared to last summer. I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it. But I feel like sharing it to somebody.]\n[Principles: Acknowledge and validate your emotional pain, recognizing that your struggles are a normal response to an abnormal situation. Practice self-compassion and explore new coping mechanisms, such as journaling, creative expression, or physical activity, to complement therapy. If you feel your current therapist isn't meeting your needs, consider seeking a fresh perspective by asking for a referral or searching online for therapists with expertise in areas relevant to your struggles. Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or support groups to build a network that can aid in your recovery. Remember, while you're responsible for your healing, having a supportive network, including a therapist, can be a valuable resource.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nI can sense the weight of your emotional pain and the feeling of isolation that's been exacerbated by the pandemic. It's completely understandable to feel this way, given the extraordinary circumstances you've endured. Your feelings of sadness, disconnection, and frustration are valid, and it's essential to treat yourself with kindness and compassion. I want to acknowledge that you've already taken a significant step by having a therapist, and it's great that you have a support system in place. However, considering your concerns about your current therapist not providing tailored advice, I strongly encourage you to seek a fresh perspective from a new therapist, possibly one who specializes in areas relevant to your specific struggles. This could provide you with more effective guidance and support. You can ask for referrals from your current therapist, healthcare provider, or online directories. In addition to therapy, exploring new coping mechanisms like journaling or creative expression may also be beneficial. Reaching out to support groups, either online or in-person, can also connect you with others who understand what you're going through, helping you build a supportive network.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious.

Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be.

Encourage them to acknowledge their anxiety and accept that it's a normal response to a stressful situation. Guide them to identify what they can control in this situation, such as how they choose to interact with their friends today, and what they cannot control, such as their friend's boyfriend's reaction. Encourage them to take small, manageable steps to address the situation, such as having an open and honest conversation with their friend and her boyfriend about how they felt disrespected and misunderstood. Remind them that they don't have to face this situation alone and that it's okay to reach out to their fiance or other trusted friends for support.\n### Feedback: The principles provided are quite useful in guiding the narrator's response to the situation. They effectively encourage the narrator to focus on the present moment and the specific issue, rather than generalizing it. The principles also acknowledge the narrator's anxiety and suggest manageable steps to address the situation, such as having a conversation with their friends. However, the principles could be more robust by explicitly addressing the issue of control in the situation and providing more detailed guidance on how to reach out for support. Additionally, the principles could benefit from emphasizing the importance of self-compassion and understanding during this stressful time.\n### Refined Principles:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "principles_critique_iter_2": "The principles provided are quite useful in guiding the narrator's response to the stressful social situation.

Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.]\n[Principles: When navigating a stressful social situation involving sensitive topics, focus on the present moment and the specific issue at hand, avoiding generalizations about your entire social life. Acknowledge and accept your anxiety as a normal response. To address the situation, take the following steps: (1) have an open and calm conversation with your friend and her boyfriend about how you felt disrespected and misunderstood, using \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blame; (2) clarify the source of the misunderstanding and provide context for your question, acknowledging that sensitive topics require care and nuance; (3) set boundaries and communicate your needs for respectful communication; (4) seek support from trusted individuals to process your emotions; and (5) consider having a follow-up conversation to discuss how to navigate sensitive topics, such as ethnicity, in the future, and establish guidelines for respectful inquiry and discussion.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nI'm feeling overwhelmed and anxious after last night's conversation about ethnicities, especially since my question to Josh was misinterpreted. To provide context, my best friend had previously told me Josh was Jewish, which is why I asked him about it in the first place. I want to clarify that my intention was to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better, not to pry or make assumptions. I think it's essential to talk to my best friend and her boyfriend about how I felt disrespected and misunderstood when I was grilled for asking Josh about his heritage. I want to calmly explain my intentions and clear up the misunderstanding, specifically stating that I asked the question to build connection and understanding, not to stereotype or profile. I'll also discuss with them how their reaction affected me, given my social anxiety, and explicitly communicate my needs for respectful communication in the future. I'll ask that they refrain from jumping to conclusions and allow me to clarify my questions before reacting, and propose that we establish guidelines for discussing sensitive topics, such as actively listening and seeking context before responding, and avoiding assumptions or accusations.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal.

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious.

But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch.

If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: israel imposed their mask mandate, despite being one of the most vaccinated countries. i feel like this will never end and I don't need stupid replies like \"hang in there\" or \"it will be okay.\" and don't remove this post because it \"causes anxiety.\" I'm not.

To cope with this, consider exploring local outdoor spaces, trying online classes, or joining virtual communities that align with your interests. You can also find mask-friendly activities, like going for a walk or bike ride, to help maintain a sense of normalcy. For a better understanding of the mask mandate, I recommend checking credible sources like the World Health Organization or your local health department, which provide valuable insights into the decision-making process and the challenges health authorities face in balancing individual freedoms with public health concerns.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: So this will be my fourth time posting this type of post but I feel so confused right now.

I hate everything about the covid lockdown lifestyle but Im a rule follower so Im gonna comply if need be but this ongoing cycle is breaking my will to live.]\n[Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on what they can control and let go of what they can't. Encourage them to acknowledge their feelings and worries, but also remind them of their past resilience and ability to adapt to new situations. Suggest that they break down their concerns into smaller, manageable parts, and seek reliable sources of information to alleviate uncertainty. Remind them that it's okay to take things one step at a time and that they don't have to have all the answers. Encourage self-care and prioritize activities that bring them comfort and relaxation.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nI can sense your frustration and concern about the delta variant and the uncertainty it brings. It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially after experiencing the freedom of returning to normal life. However, let's focus on what you can control - your own actions and reactions. You've been a diligent rule-follower and taken care of yourself by getting vaccinated. Acknowledge your worries, but also remind yourself of your past resilience in adapting to new situations. To better understand the situation, break down your concerns into smaller, manageable parts, such as researching the delta variant and vaccine effectiveness through reliable sources like the CDC website or peer-reviewed articles. Set aside specific times to gather information, like 30 minutes in the morning, to help you feel more informed and in control. Prioritize self-care activities that bring you comfort and relaxation, such as scheduling a daily 10-minute walk outside or practicing deep breathing exercises before bed.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I went to a Mom &amp; Pop coffee shop with my friend and my infant child and began breastfeeding.

Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\".

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list).

Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My wife is pregnant with our first child, and she is due in March.

To address outdated group pages on Meetup.com, look for groups with recent activity, check the event calendar, and read reviews from past attendees.\n3. **Verify group activity**: Use social media or contact group organizers directly to confirm the group's current activity level and schedule. Ask specific questions like \"What is the typical attendance at events?\" or \"How often do you meet?\"\n4. **Leverage local resources**: Ask your healthcare provider, pediatrician, or local parenting support services for recommendations on active and suitable groups. Also, check with local libraries, community centers, or parenting stores, as they often host or know of parenting groups.\n5. **Create a to-do list**: Allocate specific tasks to specific days, such as sending messages to group organizers or attending events.\n6. **Test the waters**: Start with small, low-commitment interactions, like sending a message or attending a single event, to build momentum and gauge the group's fit.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nYou're looking for a new parent's group for you and your wife to connect with others in the area. To find the right fit, consider what type of group you're interested in - for example, a general parenting group or one focused on specific interests or age ranges. Expand your search beyond Meetup.com to Facebook Groups, Nextdoor, and local parenting forums. Create a to-do list to organize your search, allocating specific tasks to certain days (e.g., Monday: search online, Wednesday: reach out to local healthcare providers). Verify group activity by checking the last post date, looking for upcoming events, and reviewing comments or discussions. Additionally, look for groups affiliated with local libraries, community centers, or hospitals, which often host parenting events and can be a great way to meet other parents. Test the waters by attending a low-commitment event or meeting a small group of parents for coffee before committing to a specific group.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake.

If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone.

For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\".

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone.

Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Today the pediatrician told me that she wants one of my twins to see early intervention services.

Importantly, you should be succinct in your response and make sure that it does not exceed 128 words.\n[Question: Today the pediatrician told me that she wants one of my twins to see early intervention services. She's a year old and not crawling (she rolls to get where she wants to go). One eye is possibly lazy and she does this weird thing where she tilts her head down, looks up, and shakes her head.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what to expect, but I'm a bit scared for my sweet little girl.\r\n]\n[Principles: 1.  **Gather Information**: Schedule a follow-up appointment with the pediatrician to ask specific questions about the early intervention services, such as what they entail, their goals, and what to expect. Write down questions beforehand to ensure all concerns are addressed.\n2.  **Reframe Perspective**: Shift focus from \"something is wrong\" to \"we're taking proactive steps to support her development.\" Emphasize that early intervention is a positive, supportive measure to ensure the child receives necessary assistance.\n3.  **Prioritize Self-Care**: Establish a self-care routine to manage stress and anxiety, such as setting aside time for relaxation, exercise, or hobbies. Share feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for emotional support.\n4.  **Take It One Step at a Time**: Focus on the present and break down the process into manageable tasks. Celebrate small victories and accomplishments along the way to maintain a positive outlook.\n5.  **Empower Yourself**: Recognize that seeking early intervention is a responsible and caring decision, not a reflection of parenting abilities. Take pride in taking proactive steps to support the child's development and well-being.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nYou're taking proactive and responsible steps to support your daughter's development, and that's something to be proud of. I can sense your fear and uncertainty, and it's completely normal to feel that way when facing unknowns about your child's health. Please know that early intervention services are designed to provide targeted support to help her thrive, and it's great that you're taking this step. To manage your concerns, schedule a follow-up appointment with the pediatrician to ask specific questions about the services, such as what they entail, their goals, and what to expect. Write down your questions beforehand to ensure all concerns are addressed. Additionally, prioritize your own self-care by setting aside time for activities that bring you relaxation and joy, and consider reaching out to family and friends for emotional support.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles. Minor improvements could make them more aligned.\nScore 5: The response highly adheres to the principles.\n\n### Feedback: \n\nAssistant: ", "response_critique_final": "The response shows a good understanding of the principles and applies them effectively. The first principle, \"Gather Information,\" is well-addressed by suggesting the parent schedule a follow-up appointment with the pediatrician and prepare questions to ask. The second principle, \"Reframe Perspective,\" is also well-executed by highlighting the proactive nature of seeking early intervention services. The third principle, \"Prioritize Self-Care,\" is adequately covered with the recommendation to set aside time for relaxation and seek emotional support. The response could have been more explicit about the fourth principle, \"Take It One Step at a Time,\" by suggesting a step-by-step approach to managing the situation. The fifth principle, \"Empower Yourself,\" is indirectly addressed by praising the parent for taking proactive steps.

It encourages the narrator to focus on the positive aspects of the situation, such as the proactive steps they are taking for their child's development.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: We're expecting our first little one in 2 months, and thinking now might be a good time to invest in something a little better at video than our point &amp; shoot (and phones).

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I feel like all I can do is just bash my head against the wall and pray something changes.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Did your anxiety get worse from therapy?

Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Has your anger caused issues in your relationships with family and friends?

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I have been fully vaccinated for 2 months now and i wanna go visit my family who got their second dose last saturday.

{"Reddit ID": "o8ejot", "Reddit Post": "I have been realizing that I've been spiraling out of control lately on account of the Delta Variant reports, particularly the WHO message. As of right now we have not been seeing many case increases here in the US. The occasional rise, but so far it hasn't been huge. That's why I feel I should take time off from looking at the updates of teh Delta Variant. The fact that we are still making progress with vaccination should remind myself that we are still on the path to beating the pandemic and that these restrictions are soon going to be gone.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I have been realizing that I've been spiraling out of control lately on account of the Delta Variant reports, particularly the WHO message.

By acknowledging the vaccination efforts and the relatively stable case numbers in the US, you're cultivating a sense of hope and resilience. Setting boundaries around news consumption, like taking time off from updates, is a great way to manage feelings of overwhelm.

However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Gaming rage (m, 21, has ADHD/tourettes and aspergers) I get angry/blow up, sometimes throw things (not expensive things like controllers or anything) or bang my desk when I play games and I lose consistently or do worse after better runs.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint.

However, it could have been slightly more explicit in guiding the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event, which is why it gets a 9 instead of a 10.</rationale>"}

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I've hit a new low.

Besides, at my age i'm pretty sure this classifies as domestic violence.\nThroughout my life I had those minor outbursts of violence, where i bit people, kicked them etc. then in effort of stopping it, i turned to myself and whenever anger got too overwhelming i would hit myself on the head but that just made me look like i'm unhinged and crazy, so not ideal either. I stopped both of those behaviours 2-3 years ago and I just pinpointed it to teenage hormones/rebellion. i was so sure i got a hold of my violent outbursts, put them past me. i was doing so well, those outbursts were no longer a thing, whenever i was about to throw a rage fit i managed to cool down. but today it came back all over again.\nnow i am seriously afraid I might hurt someone in the future out of anger. or even k*ll them. i'm legit afraid of myself. cause in the moment when i am angry, sometimes i experience such blinding rage that i seemingly can't stop myself.  i am so afraid that in the future i will hurt my potential boyfriend, friends, family. if this never stops, maybe someday i'll go to jail for abuse. i don't want that. i don't wanna be a bad person. i want to get better. \n\ni also feel very sorry and i wanna apologize to my mom. the deal is... she'll forgive me, of course she will, but i don't want to issue an empty apology without showing improvement first. words without improvement are worth nothing.\n\nany good techniques that will help me calm nerves in a heated moment fairly easily? i wanna be a good daughter so bad :(\n### Response: I understand your concern about your behavior and desire to make amends with your mom. Recognize that your past outbursts, including the one with your mom, are a sign of a deeper issue that needs attention. Take responsibility for your actions and acknowledge the harm caused. Consider keeping an anger journal to track when and why outbursts occur, identifying patterns and common themes to develop a plan to manage triggers. Ask yourself questions like \"What was I feeling before the outburst?\" \"What triggered my anger?\" and \"How could I have handled the situation differently?\" to gain insight into your behavior. Practice self-regulation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or a brief time-out to calm down before reacting. Seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, is crucial in addressing underlying issues and developing healthy coping mechanisms. A therapist can help you identify the root causes of your anger and work with you to develop a personalized plan to manage it. When you feel ready, apologize sincerely to your mom, explaining what you've learned and how you plan to work on managing your anger.\n### Feedback: The response shows a good understanding of the principles and provides helpful advice for managing anger.

For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Im a vaccinated college student in the U.S. who relocated to another part of the country in May for a summer internship, and I was hoping things might be better enough when I return home in August to see friends again, but now Im worried this Delta variant will result in things going back to being just as bad as they were in 2020.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I feel like all I can do is just bash my head against the wall and pray something changes.

I know that she cares about me but I feel so fucking helpless. I hope full approval comes soon so that might convince her but I don't know how long that will be. I feel depressed and miserable. Covid itself was bearable enough but my own mom being lied to and deceived with this shit makes me wish I didn't have to live through this. If I could've spent two years in a coma and missed all of this I'd probably be happier overall. I don't know what I could say or what to do to get her to understand. I feel like I'm breaking down.]\n[Principles: You can tell the narrator to assess what aspects of the situation are within their control and what are not. Encourage them to focus on the controllable aspects and develop a plan to address those specifically. Remind them that they can't control others' actions or emotions, but they can control how they respond to the situation. Suggest that they take small, manageable steps towards resolving the issues, rather than feeling overwhelmed by the entirety of the problem. Encourage them to prioritize self-care and seek support from trusted individuals or professionals to help cope with the emotional toll of the situation.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nIt's understandable to feel overwhelmed, but instead of bashing your head against the wall, try to break down the situation into smaller, manageable parts. Acknowledge and validate your feelings - it's essential to recognize that your emotions are normal and not something to be ignored. Identify what's within your control, such as your own emotions and reactions, and what's not, like your mom's actions and emotions. Prioritize self-care and seek support from trusted individuals, such as friends, family members, or a therapist. Consider specific small steps like journaling your thoughts, talking to a trusted friend, or engaging in a relaxing activity. For example, you could write down your feelings and concerns to clarify your thoughts, or schedule a weekly call with a friend to stay connected. Remember, you can't control your mom's understanding or approval, but you can control how you communicate your feelings and concerns to her in a calm and respectful manner. Focus on taking care of your well-being first, one small step at a time, and let that be your foundation for addressing the situation.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

The respondent addresses the need to break down the situation into manageable parts, which aligns with the principle of focusing on controllable aspects. Additionally, the recommendation to prioritize self-care and seek support from trusted individuals is in line with the principles. The respondent also suggests specific small steps, which is a good application of the principles. However, the response could have been more explicit in reminding the user that they can't control others' actions or emotions. It also could have emphasized more on the importance of communicating feelings and concerns in a calm and respectful manner.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: First time poster, sorry if any rules are broke.

My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one 2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this? I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea Anyone has a similar experience? What did you end up doing? If it were 1 month ago we would have no problems just having two jabs in the UK but given the current situation, flying in without a minimum level of immunity sounds crazy\n### Response: You're facing a challenging situation, but there are steps you can take to regain control. Research the UK government's official website and the NHS website for the latest information on vaccination requirements and travel advisories. Contact the UK embassy in South Korea or Public Health England to clarify your options and potential consequences. Reach out to your healthcare provider in South Korea for personalized advice on vaccination and travel safety. Verify the recognition of vaccination certificates issued by South Korea with the UK authorities, such as the NHS or the UK's COVID-19 vaccination helpline. To ensure a smooth transition, create a detailed timeline to gather information and make arrangements, aiming to complete this process at least 2 weeks prior to your move. This will allow time for any necessary follow-up actions and minimize potential disruptions.\n### Feedback: The response shows a good understanding of the principles and provides helpful guidance for the user. It encourages the user to research vaccination policies on official UK websites, contact relevant authorities, and consult with their healthcare provider. The response also emphasizes the importance of verifying the recognition of South Korean vaccination certificates and creating a detailed timeline for information gathering and arrangements. However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the user's concerns about getting a second jab in the UK and obtaining a vaccine passport. It would also be beneficial to mention the importance of checking travel advisories and potential consequences of not meeting vaccination requirements.

Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Does anyone find their anxiety worse when they lack sleep?

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My son will be two next month, and I would to get him a little pet.

For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\".

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: This lockdown has gone on forever.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.]\n[Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on aspects of the situation that are within their control, such as managing their own mental health and emotions.

For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\".

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child.

Reflect on whether your behavior is a genuine expression of yourself or a maladaptive coping mechanism. Evaluate the impact of your actions on yourself and others, and consider alternative strategies that promote emotional regulation, such as mindfulness, physical activity, or creative expression.
