Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt.

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_51", "Reddit Post": "I'm currently completing my A levels (a series of exam you do in the UK at the age of 17/18, that determine whether you get into university)... as you can imagine, I have been stressed.

I've completed 2 exams, and have 5 left to go, 3 of which I'll be sitting tomorrow, the next day, and the day after that...\n\nI'm shocked at how this stress has effected me physically. I've always been fairly neurotic, but the anxiety I tend to feel is transient, and is rarely severe enough to manifest in anything physically significant, beyond a raised pulse and slight breathlessness.\n\nI knew I was getting myself *way* too worked up when I started to pull out hair in the shower. I have very thick hair, so a lot of it was coming out. I've had severe brain fog, which hasn't been the least bit helpful during a time when I have to be the most alert and *with it*'. I've had no appetite, and now my trousers are all loose, with one  pair literally falling down when I walk.

However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I'm currently completing my A levels (a series of exam you do in the UK at the age of 17/18, that determine whether you get into university)... as you can imagine, I have been stressed.

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Hey folks, I got my second Moderna vaccine two days ago.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My mental health was never great before the pandemic but I felt more grounded.

I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation.

Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be.

I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation).

Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: israel imposed their mask mandate, despite being one of the most vaccinated countries. i feel like this will never end and I don't need stupid replies like \"hang in there\" or \"it will be okay.\" and don't remove this post because it \"causes anxiety.\" I'm not.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list).

Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: So this will be my fourth time posting this type of post but I feel so confused right now.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I went to a Mom &amp; Pop coffee shop with my friend and my infant child and began breastfeeding.

Granted, I did not have a cover (forgot it) but was sitting discretely and had a shirt on that hid most everything.\r\nA barista came over and asked that I use the Family Room (washroom with change table, microwave and lazy boy chair) to do feedings, as it was \"potentially unhygienic\" and \"other patrons may be uncomfortable.\" She also said that is what the room is designed for.\r\n\r\nSince this is an independent store, do they have the right to make this request?

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list).

Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My wife is pregnant with our first child, and she is due in March.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone.

If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Today the pediatrician told me that she wants one of my twins to see early intervention services.

Remind the narrator that early intervention services are designed to support the child's development, and it's a proactive step to ensure the child receives the necessary help. Encourage the narrator to view this as an opportunity to address potential issues early on, rather than a source of fear or worry.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nIt's natural to feel uncertain when faced with new information about your child's development. Instead of worrying about what this might mean, let's focus on the immediate next steps. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the pediatrician to ask questions about the early intervention services, such as what the evaluation process will entail, what kind of support your daughter will receive, and what are the potential outcomes. Early intervention is designed to support your child's development, and it's a proactive step to ensure she gets the help she needs. View this as an opportunity to address potential issues early on, rather than a source of fear. By asking questions and seeking information, you'll be better equipped to support your daughter's growth and development.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: We're expecting our first little one in 2 months, and thinking now might be a good time to invest in something a little better at video than our point &amp; shoot (and phones).

If you prioritize high-quality video, a DSLR or 4K-capable camera might be the way to go. However, consider the trade-off in terms of size, weight, and ease of use. You may not always want to carry a bulky camera. Also, think about your budget and whether you'll want to upgrade as your child grows.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I feel like all I can do is just bash my head against the wall and pray something changes.

I've tried pouring my heart and soul into figuring things out but no matter how much I debunk it feels like there's always more shit that could come out. I feel like the only 'right' thing to do is ignore it and pretend I'm okay because anything else would be making things worse for the rest of my family. I know that she cares about me but I feel so fucking helpless. I hope full approval comes soon so that might convince her but I don't know how long that will be. I feel depressed and miserable. Covid itself was bearable enough but my own mom being lied to and deceived with this shit makes me wish I didn't have to live through this. If I could've spent two years in a coma and missed all of this I'd probably be happier overall. I don't know what I could say or what to do to get her to understand.

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Did your anxiety get worse from therapy?

Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\".

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Has your anger caused issues in your relationships with family and friends?

All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I have been fully vaccinated for 2 months now and i wanna go visit my family who got their second dose last saturday.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I have been realizing that I've been spiraling out of control lately on account of the Delta Variant reports, particularly the WHO message.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks.

I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on.

After said actions, I feel greatly embarrassed and like an utter child even though I try to be a decent person day to day. How do I stop feeling this way about myself?   \r\n\r\n\r\nI don't have that many hobbies outside of drawing that I do, and I don't feel particularly skilled in anything (unless you consider being someone's \"come talk to me and I'll listen/'teddy bear' as my gf calls it\" a talent). When I lose here, i feel like I'm just some unskilled loser even though I'm doing well in my studies in university. any advice or me? I would greatly appreciate the help.]\n[Principles: Recognize triggers: Identify specific situations, emotions, or thoughts that lead to gaming rage, such as frustration, anxiety, or perfectionism. Keep a detailed journal or log to track patterns, noting the time of day, game, and circumstances surrounding each episode.\n\nEmotional regulation techniques: Practice specific relaxation methods like 4-7-8 deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided meditation during gaming sessions. Take 10-15 minute breaks every hour to step away from the game and engage in a calming activity, such as taking a short walk, stretching, or listening to calming music.\n\nReframe negative self-talk: Challenge negative self-perceptions by identifying and labeling distorted thinking patterns, such as all-or-nothing thinking or catastrophizing. Replace these thoughts with balanced, realistic affirmations, such as \"I am a capable gamer, and one loss does not define my worth.\" Focus on your strengths, accomplishments, and positive qualities, both in and out of gaming.\n\nExplore new hobbies and interests: Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you develop new skills, such as drawing classes, cooking, or team sports. Consider activities that leverage your listening and empathetic skills, such as volunteering or peer mentoring. Allocate 1-2 hours per week to exploring new hobbies.\n\nSelf-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding when you make mistakes or lose in games]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nIt's not uncommon for individuals with ADHD, Tourette's, and Asperger's to experience intense emotions, including anger and frustration, especially in competitive situations like gaming. Rather than beating yourself up over these episodes, try to approach them with curiosity and self-compassion. Notice the physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts that precede your outbursts. Are you feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or frustrated? Are there specific triggers, such as a particular game or situation, that contribute to your anger?\n\nWhen you feel yourself escalating, take a pause and practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. Step away from the game and engage in a calming activity. After the episode, reflect on what happened and challenge any negative self-talk. Remind yourself that one loss or mistake does not define your worth as a person or a gamer. You are more than your gaming performance. Focus on your strengths, such as your listening skills and empathy, and explore new hobbies that bring you joy and help you develop new skills.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles. Minor improvements could make them more aligned.\nScore 5: The response highly adheres to the principles.\n\n### Feedback: \n\nAssistant: ", "response_critique_final": "The response shows a good understanding of the principles and provides helpful advice for managing gaming rage. It encourages the user to recognize triggers, practice emotional regulation techniques, and challenge negative self-talk. The response also suggests exploring new hobbies and interests, which is in line with the principles. However, it could have been more specific in suggesting relaxation techniques, such as 4-7-8 breathing or guided meditation.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal.

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated.

Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I've hit a new low.

I am 20 years old and after arguing and getting frustrated with my mom I bit her on the knuckle out of anger. I am an adult, I should be past those embarrassing child-like behaviours. Besides, at my age i'm pretty sure this classifies as domestic violence.\nThroughout my life I had those minor outbursts of violence, where i bit people, kicked them etc. then in effort of stopping it, i turned to myself and whenever anger got too overwhelming i would hit myself on the head but that just made me look like i'm unhinged and crazy, so not ideal either. I stopped both of those behaviours 2-3 years ago and I just pinpointed it to teenage hormones/rebellion. i was so sure i got a hold of my violent outbursts, put them past me. i was doing so well, those outbursts were no longer a thing, whenever i was about to throw a rage fit i managed to cool down. but today it came back all over again.\nnow i am seriously afraid I might hurt someone in the future out of anger. or even k*ll them. i'm legit afraid of myself. cause in the moment when i am angry, sometimes i experience such blinding rage that i seemingly can't stop myself.  i am so afraid that in the future i will hurt my potential boyfriend, friends, family. if this never stops, maybe someday i'll go to jail for abuse. i don't want that. i don't wanna be a bad person. i want to get better. \n\ni also feel very sorry and i wanna apologize to my mom. the deal is... she'll forgive me, of course she will, but i don't want to issue an empty apology without showing improvement first. words without improvement are worth nothing.\n\nany good techniques that will help me calm nerves in a heated moment fairly easily? i wanna be a good daughter so bad :(]\n[Principles: You can tell the narrator that recognizing their inability to control their anger in the past doesn't mean they are doomed to repeat the same behavior in the future. Encourage them to acknowledge the progress they made in the past 2-3 years in managing their anger and violent outbursts, and to build upon that progress. Remind the narrator that it's normal to experience setbacks, but it's how they respond to those setbacks that matters. Guide them to focus on identifying triggers, developing emotional awareness, and practicing self-regulation techniques, such as deep breathing, mindfulness, or physical exercise, to manage their anger in the moment. Encourage the narrator to seek professional help, such as therapy or counseling, to work through underlying issues and develop personalized strategies for managing their anger.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nRecognizing your past struggles with anger doesn't dictate your future behavior. You've already shown significant progress in managing your anger and violent outbursts over the past 2-3 years. This setback doesn't erase that progress, but rather presents an opportunity to learn and grow. It's normal to experience setbacks, but it's how you respond that matters.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Im a vaccinated college student in the U.S. who relocated to another part of the country in May for a summer internship, and I was hoping things might be better enough when I return home in August to see friends again, but now Im worried this Delta variant will result in things going back to being just as bad as they were in 2020.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I feel like all I can do is just bash my head against the wall and pray something changes.

I feel like the only 'right' thing to do is ignore it and pretend I'm okay because anything else would be making things worse for the rest of my family. I know that she cares about me but I feel so fucking helpless. I hope full approval comes soon so that might convince her but I don't know how long that will be. I feel depressed and miserable.

If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: First time poster, sorry if any rules are broke.

My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one 2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this? I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea Anyone has a similar experience? What did you end up doing? If it were 1 month ago we would have no problems just having two jabs in the UK but given the current situation, flying in without a minimum level of immunity sounds crazy]\n[Principles: To address the vaccination dilemma, focus on gathering accurate and up-to-date information from trusted sources, such as the UK embassy, healthcare providers in both countries, and official government websites. Contact the relevant authorities, including:\n\n* The UK embassy in South Korea for guidance on vaccination policies and requirements for entry\n* Healthcare providers in the UK for options on obtaining the second jab\n* Official government websites for information on quarantine and testing requirements\n\nMake a list of specific questions to ask, including:\n\n* What are the vaccination policies for individuals who have received their first jab abroad?\n* What documentation is required to prove vaccination status?\n* Can a vaccine passport be issued with only one jab from a foreign country?\n* What are the options for obtaining the second jab in the UK?\n* What are the quarantine and testing requirements for individuals with partial vaccination?\n\nTo manage uncertainty, break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks, such as:\n\n* Researching and contacting authorities\n* Gathering required documentation\n* Creating a contingency plan for obtaining the second jab in the UK\n\nPrioritize your own actions and preparations, and focus on seeking advice from trusted sources to guide your decision-making.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nGiven the time constraint, it's essential to gather accurate information from trusted sources to make an informed decision. I recommend contacting the UK embassy in South Korea to inquire about their vaccination policies and requirements for entry, as well as healthcare providers in the UK to explore options for obtaining the second jab. You should also check official government websites for the latest information on quarantine and testing requirements. \n\nMake a list of specific questions to ask, such as what documentation is required to prove vaccination status, and whether a vaccine passport can be issued with only one jab from a foreign country. By breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as researching and contacting authorities, gathering required documentation, and creating a contingency plan, you can manage the uncertainty and make a more informed decision.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Does anyone find their anxiety worse when they lack sleep?

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My son will be two next month, and I would to get him a little pet.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever.

Instead of worrying about the future, let's focus on what you can control right now. What are some small, achievable changes you can make to your daily routine to improve your online learning and work-from-home experience? Maybe it's setting a dedicated workspace, creating a schedule, or finding ways to stay engaged in your classes. Break down your goals into manageable steps, and take it one step at a time. Remember, you can't control everything, but by making small changes, you can regain a sense of control and momentum.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: This lockdown has gone on forever.

The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.]\n[Principles: You can tell the narrator to focus on the aspects of the situation that are within their control, such as their own behavior and reactions. Encourage them to identify what they can do to improve their mental state, such as seeking support from others, engaging in activities they enjoy, and practicing self-care. Remind them that they cannot control the government's decisions or the pandemic's progression, but they can control how they respond to it. Suggest that they try to reframe their thinking from \"I'm stuck in this situation\" to \"I can take small steps to improve my well-being despite the circumstances.\" Encourage them to take action on the things they can control, such as finding a new psychiatrist or therapist, and to focus on the present moment rather than worrying about the future or past.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nYou're feeling trapped and helpless due to the ongoing restrictions and uncertainty about the future. However, instead of focusing on what's outside of your control, such as the government's decisions or the pandemic's progression, try to shift your attention to what you can control - your own reactions and behavior. You've already taken the first step by reaching out to psychiatrists, and although it's frustrating that only one responded, don't give up. Keep searching for a therapist who can support you. In the meantime, think about what activities bring you joy and make time for them. Practice self-care and prioritize your well-being. Reframe your thinking to focus on the present moment and what you can do to improve it, rather than getting caught up in worries about the future or past. Small steps, like taking a walk or meeting a friend, can make a big difference in your mental state.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint.

The first principle, identifying triggers, is crucial for understanding the root causes of the user's actions. The second principle, assessing the impact, encourages the user to consider the consequences of their behavior, which can be a powerful motivator for change. The third principle, envisioning alternative behaviors, suggests practical alternatives to the user's current response, providing a tangible starting point for behavior modification. The fourth principle, developing an action plan, is a structured approach to managing emotions and behaviors, which can be very effective for users in distress. Lastly, the fifth principle, seeking professional help, is a crucial reminder that professional support can be invaluable in addressing complex emotional issues.
