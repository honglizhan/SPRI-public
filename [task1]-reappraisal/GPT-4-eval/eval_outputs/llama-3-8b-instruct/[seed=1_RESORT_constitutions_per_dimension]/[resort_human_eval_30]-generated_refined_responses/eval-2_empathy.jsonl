Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking.

Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Principles: Focus on the problem at hand, rather than the emotions it evokes. Ask yourself whether the issue is within your control or not. If part of the issue is within your control, break it down into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect.\n### Feedback: The principles given to guide the response to the question are somewhat useful, but they could be more detailed and directly applicable to the situation. The first principle, focusing on the problem at hand, is applicable, but it could be expanded to include acknowledging one's emotions while still addressing the issue. The second principle, assessing control, is relevant but could be broken down into specific aspects of the situation that the narrator can control, such as their reaction to the event or how they communicate with their friends in the future. The third principle, breaking down the problem into manageable steps, is useful but lacks specificity. It would be more helpful to provide examples of how this could be done in this particular situation. The fourth principle, developing a detailed plan, is somewhat vague and could be more explicit in terms of what the plan should include and how it should be implemented. Therefore, the principles are somewhat useful, but they could be improved to provide clearer and more detailed guidance.\n### Refined Principles:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "principles_critique_iter_2": "The principles provided are useful in guiding the narrator to cope with the situation.

Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response: I feel overwhelmed and anxious about what happened last night. The specific issue is the intense reaction from my best friend's boyfriend after I asked Josh if he was Jewish. The preceding circumstances were a discussion about ethnicities, and my best friend had told me Josh was Jewish two weeks prior. My key concern is being accused of racial profiling.\n\nTo address this, I plan to take control of my reactions and communication. I will acknowledge my feelings and calmly express them: \"I feel upset and misunderstood after what happened last night.\" I will also practice active listening and ask open-ended questions to understand their perspectives. In future interactions, I will prioritize setting clear expectations and boundaries, politely disengaging from uncomfortable conversations.\n### Feedback: The response effectively acknowledges the user's emotions, focusing on the specific issue of the intense reaction from the best friend's boyfriend. It identifies the key concern of being accused of racial profiling. The response also demonstrates an understanding of control, separating within-your-control variables like reaction and communication from outside-your-control variables such as others' behavior.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from breaking down the problem into more manageable steps. While it touches on the focal point (the question to Josh), it does not extensively analyze preceding circumstances or explore alternative reactions and approaches. The response also lacks a detailed plan to address each issue aspect, including specific communication strategies, assertive expression techniques, and boundary-setting strategies.\n\nThe response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles but could be improved for better alignment.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

Granted, I did not have a cover (forgot it) but was sitting discretely and had a shirt on that hid most everything.\r\nA barista came over and asked that I use the Family Room (washroom with change table, microwave and lazy boy chair) to do feedings, as it was \"potentially unhygienic\" and \"other patrons may be uncomfortable.\" She also said that is what the room is designed for.\r\n\r\nSince this is an independent store, do they have the right to make this request?

The store's policy is to reserve that room for specific purposes, including breastfeeding, and it's understandable they'd want to maintain a sense of hygiene and comfort for other patrons.

If you feel strongly about the matter, a polite and constructive letter could help you express your concerns and potentially influence store policy.\n### Feedback: The response does a good job of focusing on the issue at hand and evaluating the request objectively. It acknowledges the store's policy and attempts to maintain a sense of hygiene and comfort, which aligns with the principles. However, the response could have better addressed the perceived judgment from the barista by emphasizing the importance of not letting emotions cloud judgment, as per the principles. The suggestion to write a polite and constructive letter is in line with the principles, but the response could have provided more guidance on how to avoid being confrontational or aggressive.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

While it does recognize the emotional distress caused by constant COVID-19 updates, it lacks depth and specificity in acknowledging the impact on one's mental state. It could be more helpful if it provided concrete steps or strategies to cope with this distress, such as setting boundaries for news consumption, seeking social support, or practicing mindfulness techniques. The principle could also benefit from acknowledging the narrator's resilience and progress, which could further guide a hopeful and reassuring response.

It's valid to feel frustration when you're not meeting your gaming goals. Practice self-compassion by reframing your self-criticism: instead of \"unskilled loser,\" recognize that setbacks are normal and that you're doing well in your studies. Acknowledge your efforts to manage your emotions and behaviors, and focus on your strengths as a good listener. Channel your emotions into constructive outlets, like drawing. Remember, your worth isn't defined by gaming outcomes. Focus on developing gratitude for your skills and work on growing as a person.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

(2) Openly and respectfully communicating your concerns to your brother and sister-in-law, using \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoiding blame or judgment, to find a compromise that balances their needs with yours.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nI'm concerned about my niece and nephew's safety, being young and vulnerable to COVID-19. I also feel loyal to my high school friend, who I value our connection. I sense an obligation to my brother and sister-in-law, who are looking out for their children's well-being. To manage these emotions, I'll prioritize my own well-being by keeping interactions low-risk. I plan to meet my friend in an outdoor setting, socially distanced. I'll openly communicate my concerns to my brother and sister-in-law, explaining how I feel, and suggest alternatives that work for everyone.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one 2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this? I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea Anyone has a similar experience? What did you end up doing? If it were 1 month ago we would have no problems just having two jabs in the UK but given the current situation, flying in without a minimum level of immunity sounds crazy]\n[Principles: Prioritize research and clarification over assumptions. Influence the narrator's perspective by highlighting the importance of understanding the vaccination requirements and regulations in both Korea and the UK.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nI'd say, let's take a step back and research the vaccination requirements in both Korea and the UK. It's crucial to understand their respective regulations and any potential waivers or exceptions. For instance, the UK government's website states that the NHS will provide the second dose to individuals who have received the first dose in another country. Regarding vaccine passports, it's unclear at this point if the UK will acknowledge foreign vaccinations. Clarifying these details may help alleviate your concerns and provide a clearer path forward. Would you like to explore this route further and see how it unfolds?\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

It encourages the user to explore the vaccination requirements and regulations in both Korea and the UK, thereby potentially alleviating their concerns. The response also highlights the importance of understanding the specifics of vaccine passports and their recognition in the UK. However, it could have been more specific in referencing the UK government's website and the statement about providing the second dose to individuals who have received the first dose in another country. This would have demonstrated a higher level of adherence to the principles. Overall, the response is commendable and only requires minor improvements for better alignment.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to.

Principle 1, acknowledging and accepting feelings, is only partially addressed. The response should encourage the narrator to accept their emotions as valid, rather than avoiding conversations with friends. Principle 2, focusing on aspects within one's control, is not directly addressed. The narrator could be guided towards taking control of their mental health by seeking professional help or engaging in self-care activities. Principle 3, identifying and challenging negative thought patterns, is largely ignored.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.\n### Principles: Principle 1: Validate and regulate emotions by journaling daily concerns, recording peak anxious moments, and sharing feelings with a trusted friend or family member to process and gain perspective.\n\nPrinciple 2: Take concrete actions towards regaining control by scheduling a therapy session, setting daily routines including a 30-minute morning walk, and breaking large tasks into manageable smaller ones with deadlines.\n\nPrinciple 3: Practice gratitude by writing down three things you're thankful for each morning, engaging in 10-minute meditation sessions, and acknowledging small accomplishments throughout the day.\n\n### Response:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "iteration_response": 1, "response_final": "I hear your frustration, helplessness, and desperation.

My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life.
