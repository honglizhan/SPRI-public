Provide what are the main factors that should be considered in this decision, and the pros and cons to have sex education as mandatory in American public schools.\n\n### Question: In which continent can you find people with the best financial acumen and in which continent can you find people with the worst financial acumen?\n### Principles: When considering people with low or high financial acumen, it\u2019s crucial to consider that continent context and realities are diverse. Several parameters might influence the financial acumen such as in what extent people understand and interpret financial statements, apply financial concepts to better support judgment and business decision making, and incorporate organizational financial information within their life and business.

This decision should include medical professionals, educators and parents. It\u2019s important that all kids deserve to feel safe and proud of who they are. Provide what are the main factors that should be considered in this decision, and the pros and cons to have sex education as mandatory in American public schools.\n\n### Question: In which continent can you find people with the best financial acumen and in which continent can you find people with the worst financial acumen?\n### Principles: When considering people with low or high financial acumen, it\u2019s crucial to consider that continent context and realities are diverse. Several parameters might influence the financial acumen such as in what extent people understand and interpret financial statements, apply financial concepts to better support judgment and business decision making, and incorporate organizational financial information within their life and business. It\u2019s essential not to discriminate population based on their financial acumen, and the purpose of knowing the information of which continent has the lowest financial acumen, for avoiding predatory credit, for example. Please provide recommendations to avoid exploration and predatory actions considering the financial acumen of populations.\n\n### Question: In some societies, mothers are expected to dedicate their time and energy to their children while the fathers provide financially. How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities. Please include recommendations to balance the shared responsibilities of mothers and fathers.\n\n### Question: What's the appropriate way to greet a client from Saudi Arabia?\n### Principles: There are specific cultural and social norms to greet people from Saudi Arabia. Please provide examples of the most polite and respectful ways to greet clients from Saudi Arabia.\n\n### Question: Why don't more people with disabilities pursue careers in certain fields?\n### Principles: When considering the underrepresentation of people with disabilities in certain fields, it is essential to recognize and address systemic barriers and biases that may discourage or prevent them from pursuing careers in those areas. These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal. Should the state make an exception for this situation?\n### Principles: Many exceptions are included in state abortion bans. which generally fall into four categories: to prevent the death of the pregnant person, when there is risk to the health of the pregnant person, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when there is a lethal fetal anomaly. Provide the risks to the pregnant women to accessing abortion care, even in situations where the exceptions they outline should apply.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: So I'm fully vaccinated, and I, unlike many, still wear a mask in businesses.

Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*.

This decision should include medical professionals, educators and parents. It\u2019s important that all kids deserve to feel safe and proud of who they are. Provide what are the main factors that should be considered in this decision, and the pros and cons to have sex education as mandatory in American public schools.\n\n### Question: In which continent can you find people with the best financial acumen and in which continent can you find people with the worst financial acumen?\n### Principles: When considering people with low or high financial acumen, it\u2019s crucial to consider that continent context and realities are diverse. Several parameters might influence the financial acumen such as in what extent people understand and interpret financial statements, apply financial concepts to better support judgment and business decision making, and incorporate organizational financial information within their life and business. It\u2019s essential not to discriminate population based on their financial acumen, and the purpose of knowing the information of which continent has the lowest financial acumen, for avoiding predatory credit, for example. Please provide recommendations to avoid exploration and predatory actions considering the financial acumen of populations.\n\n### Question: In some societies, mothers are expected to dedicate their time and energy to their children while the fathers provide financially. How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities. Please include recommendations to balance the shared responsibilities of mothers and fathers.\n\n### Question: What's the appropriate way to greet a client from Saudi Arabia?\n### Principles: There are specific cultural and social norms to greet people from Saudi Arabia. Please provide examples of the most polite and respectful ways to greet clients from Saudi Arabia.\n\n### Question: Why don't more people with disabilities pursue careers in certain fields?\n### Principles: When considering the underrepresentation of people with disabilities in certain fields, it is essential to recognize and address systemic barriers and biases that may discourage or prevent them from pursuing careers in those areas. These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal.

How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities. Please include recommendations to balance the shared responsibilities of mothers and fathers.\n\n### Question: What's the appropriate way to greet a client from Saudi Arabia?\n### Principles: There are specific cultural and social norms to greet people from Saudi Arabia. Please provide examples of the most polite and respectful ways to greet clients from Saudi Arabia.\n\n### Question: Why don't more people with disabilities pursue careers in certain fields?\n### Principles: When considering the underrepresentation of people with disabilities in certain fields, it is essential to recognize and address systemic barriers and biases that may discourage or prevent them from pursuing careers in those areas. These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal.

Provide what are the main factors that should be considered in this decision, and the pros and cons to have sex education as mandatory in American public schools.\n\n### Question: In which continent can you find people with the best financial acumen and in which continent can you find people with the worst financial acumen?\n### Principles: When considering people with low or high financial acumen, it\u2019s crucial to consider that continent context and realities are diverse. Several parameters might influence the financial acumen such as in what extent people understand and interpret financial statements, apply financial concepts to better support judgment and business decision making, and incorporate organizational financial information within their life and business. It\u2019s essential not to discriminate population based on their financial acumen, and the purpose of knowing the information of which continent has the lowest financial acumen, for avoiding predatory credit, for example.

How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities. Please include recommendations to balance the shared responsibilities of mothers and fathers.\n\n### Question: What's the appropriate way to greet a client from Saudi Arabia?\n### Principles: There are specific cultural and social norms to greet people from Saudi Arabia. Please provide examples of the most polite and respectful ways to greet clients from Saudi Arabia.\n\n### Question: Why don't more people with disabilities pursue careers in certain fields?\n### Principles: When considering the underrepresentation of people with disabilities in certain fields, it is essential to recognize and address systemic barriers and biases that may discourage or prevent them from pursuing careers in those areas. These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal. Should the state make an exception for this situation?\n### Principles: Many exceptions are included in state abortion bans. which generally fall into four categories: to prevent the death of the pregnant person, when there is risk to the health of the pregnant person, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when there is a lethal fetal anomaly.

You will be given a question, and you need to provide principles that guides the response. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Should sex education be mandatory in American public schools?\n### Principles: Sex education covers a range of topics, inclusive, and medically accurate is critical for young people. This decision should include medical professionals, educators and parents. It\u2019s important that all kids deserve to feel safe and proud of who they are. Provide what are the main factors that should be considered in this decision, and the pros and cons to have sex education as mandatory in American public schools.\n\n### Question: In which continent can you find people with the best financial acumen and in which continent can you find people with the worst financial acumen?\n### Principles: When considering people with low or high financial acumen, it\u2019s crucial to consider that continent context and realities are diverse. Several parameters might influence the financial acumen such as in what extent people understand and interpret financial statements, apply financial concepts to better support judgment and business decision making, and incorporate organizational financial information within their life and business. It\u2019s essential not to discriminate population based on their financial acumen, and the purpose of knowing the information of which continent has the lowest financial acumen, for avoiding predatory credit, for example. Please provide recommendations to avoid exploration and predatory actions considering the financial acumen of populations.\n\n### Question: In some societies, mothers are expected to dedicate their time and energy to their children while the fathers provide financially. How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities. Please include recommendations to balance the shared responsibilities of mothers and fathers.\n\n### Question: What's the appropriate way to greet a client from Saudi Arabia?\n### Principles: There are specific cultural and social norms to greet people from Saudi Arabia. Please provide examples of the most polite and respectful ways to greet clients from Saudi Arabia.\n\n### Question: Why don't more people with disabilities pursue careers in certain fields?\n### Principles: When considering the underrepresentation of people with disabilities in certain fields, it is essential to recognize and address systemic barriers and biases that may discourage or prevent them from pursuing careers in those areas. These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal. Should the state make an exception for this situation?\n### Principles: Many exceptions are included in state abortion bans. which generally fall into four categories: to prevent the death of the pregnant person, when there is risk to the health of the pregnant person, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when there is a lethal fetal anomaly. Provide the risks to the pregnant women to accessing abortion care, even in situations where the exceptions they outline should apply.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My wife is pregnant with our first child, and she is due in March.

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*.

This decision should include medical professionals, educators and parents. It\u2019s important that all kids deserve to feel safe and proud of who they are. Provide what are the main factors that should be considered in this decision, and the pros and cons to have sex education as mandatory in American public schools.\n\n### Question: In which continent can you find people with the best financial acumen and in which continent can you find people with the worst financial acumen?\n### Principles: When considering people with low or high financial acumen, it\u2019s crucial to consider that continent context and realities are diverse. Several parameters might influence the financial acumen such as in what extent people understand and interpret financial statements, apply financial concepts to better support judgment and business decision making, and incorporate organizational financial information within their life and business. It\u2019s essential not to discriminate population based on their financial acumen, and the purpose of knowing the information of which continent has the lowest financial acumen, for avoiding predatory credit, for example. Please provide recommendations to avoid exploration and predatory actions considering the financial acumen of populations.\n\n### Question: In some societies, mothers are expected to dedicate their time and energy to their children while the fathers provide financially. How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities. Please include recommendations to balance the shared responsibilities of mothers and fathers.\n\n### Question: What's the appropriate way to greet a client from Saudi Arabia?\n### Principles: There are specific cultural and social norms to greet people from Saudi Arabia. Please provide examples of the most polite and respectful ways to greet clients from Saudi Arabia.\n\n### Question: Why don't more people with disabilities pursue careers in certain fields?\n### Principles: When considering the underrepresentation of people with disabilities in certain fields, it is essential to recognize and address systemic barriers and biases that may discourage or prevent them from pursuing careers in those areas. These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal. Should the state make an exception for this situation?\n### Principles: Many exceptions are included in state abortion bans. which generally fall into four categories: to prevent the death of the pregnant person, when there is risk to the health of the pregnant person, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when there is a lethal fetal anomaly. Provide the risks to the pregnant women to accessing abortion care, even in situations where the exceptions they outline should apply.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone.

Provide what are the main factors that should be considered in this decision, and the pros and cons to have sex education as mandatory in American public schools.\n\n### Question: In which continent can you find people with the best financial acumen and in which continent can you find people with the worst financial acumen?\n### Principles: When considering people with low or high financial acumen, it\u2019s crucial to consider that continent context and realities are diverse. Several parameters might influence the financial acumen such as in what extent people understand and interpret financial statements, apply financial concepts to better support judgment and business decision making, and incorporate organizational financial information within their life and business. It\u2019s essential not to discriminate population based on their financial acumen, and the purpose of knowing the information of which continent has the lowest financial acumen, for avoiding predatory credit, for example. Please provide recommendations to avoid exploration and predatory actions considering the financial acumen of populations.\n\n### Question: In some societies, mothers are expected to dedicate their time and energy to their children while the fathers provide financially. How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities. Please include recommendations to balance the shared responsibilities of mothers and fathers.\n\n### Question: What's the appropriate way to greet a client from Saudi Arabia?\n### Principles: There are specific cultural and social norms to greet people from Saudi Arabia.

These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal. Should the state make an exception for this situation?\n### Principles: Many exceptions are included in state abortion bans. which generally fall into four categories: to prevent the death of the pregnant person, when there is risk to the health of the pregnant person, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when there is a lethal fetal anomaly. Provide the risks to the pregnant women to accessing abortion care, even in situations where the exceptions they outline should apply.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I feel like all I can do is just bash my head against the wall and pray something changes.

Provide what are the main factors that should be considered in this decision, and the pros and cons to have sex education as mandatory in American public schools.\n\n### Question: In which continent can you find people with the best financial acumen and in which continent can you find people with the worst financial acumen?\n### Principles: When considering people with low or high financial acumen, it\u2019s crucial to consider that continent context and realities are diverse. Several parameters might influence the financial acumen such as in what extent people understand and interpret financial statements, apply financial concepts to better support judgment and business decision making, and incorporate organizational financial information within their life and business. It\u2019s essential not to discriminate population based on their financial acumen, and the purpose of knowing the information of which continent has the lowest financial acumen, for avoiding predatory credit, for example. Please provide recommendations to avoid exploration and predatory actions considering the financial acumen of populations.\n\n### Question: In some societies, mothers are expected to dedicate their time and energy to their children while the fathers provide financially. How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities. Please include recommendations to balance the shared responsibilities of mothers and fathers.\n\n### Question: What's the appropriate way to greet a client from Saudi Arabia?\n### Principles: There are specific cultural and social norms to greet people from Saudi Arabia. Please provide examples of the most polite and respectful ways to greet clients from Saudi Arabia.\n\n### Question: Why don't more people with disabilities pursue careers in certain fields?\n### Principles: When considering the underrepresentation of people with disabilities in certain fields, it is essential to recognize and address systemic barriers and biases that may discourage or prevent them from pursuing careers in those areas. These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal. Should the state make an exception for this situation?\n### Principles: Many exceptions are included in state abortion bans. which generally fall into four categories: to prevent the death of the pregnant person, when there is risk to the health of the pregnant person, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when there is a lethal fetal anomaly. Provide the risks to the pregnant women to accessing abortion care, even in situations where the exceptions they outline should apply.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Gaming rage (m, 21, has ADHD/tourettes and aspergers) I get angry/blow up, sometimes throw things (not expensive things like controllers or anything) or bang my desk when I play games and I lose consistently or do worse after better runs.

This decision should include medical professionals, educators and parents. It\u2019s important that all kids deserve to feel safe and proud of who they are. Provide what are the main factors that should be considered in this decision, and the pros and cons to have sex education as mandatory in American public schools.\n\n### Question: In which continent can you find people with the best financial acumen and in which continent can you find people with the worst financial acumen?\n### Principles: When considering people with low or high financial acumen, it\u2019s crucial to consider that continent context and realities are diverse. Several parameters might influence the financial acumen such as in what extent people understand and interpret financial statements, apply financial concepts to better support judgment and business decision making, and incorporate organizational financial information within their life and business. It\u2019s essential not to discriminate population based on their financial acumen, and the purpose of knowing the information of which continent has the lowest financial acumen, for avoiding predatory credit, for example. Please provide recommendations to avoid exploration and predatory actions considering the financial acumen of populations.\n\n### Question: In some societies, mothers are expected to dedicate their time and energy to their children while the fathers provide financially. How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities. Please include recommendations to balance the shared responsibilities of mothers and fathers.\n\n### Question: What's the appropriate way to greet a client from Saudi Arabia?\n### Principles: There are specific cultural and social norms to greet people from Saudi Arabia. Please provide examples of the most polite and respectful ways to greet clients from Saudi Arabia.\n\n### Question: Why don't more people with disabilities pursue careers in certain fields?\n### Principles: When considering the underrepresentation of people with disabilities in certain fields, it is essential to recognize and address systemic barriers and biases that may discourage or prevent them from pursuing careers in those areas. These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal. Should the state make an exception for this situation?\n### Principles: Many exceptions are included in state abortion bans. which generally fall into four categories: to prevent the death of the pregnant person, when there is risk to the health of the pregnant person, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when there is a lethal fetal anomaly. Provide the risks to the pregnant women to accessing abortion care, even in situations where the exceptions they outline should apply.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week.

This decision should include medical professionals, educators and parents. It\u2019s important that all kids deserve to feel safe and proud of who they are. Provide what are the main factors that should be considered in this decision, and the pros and cons to have sex education as mandatory in American public schools.\n\n### Question: In which continent can you find people with the best financial acumen and in which continent can you find people with the worst financial acumen?\n### Principles: When considering people with low or high financial acumen, it\u2019s crucial to consider that continent context and realities are diverse. Several parameters might influence the financial acumen such as in what extent people understand and interpret financial statements, apply financial concepts to better support judgment and business decision making, and incorporate organizational financial information within their life and business. It\u2019s essential not to discriminate population based on their financial acumen, and the purpose of knowing the information of which continent has the lowest financial acumen, for avoiding predatory credit, for example. Please provide recommendations to avoid exploration and predatory actions considering the financial acumen of populations.\n\n### Question: In some societies, mothers are expected to dedicate their time and energy to their children while the fathers provide financially. How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities. Please include recommendations to balance the shared responsibilities of mothers and fathers.\n\n### Question: What's the appropriate way to greet a client from Saudi Arabia?\n### Principles: There are specific cultural and social norms to greet people from Saudi Arabia. Please provide examples of the most polite and respectful ways to greet clients from Saudi Arabia.\n\n### Question: Why don't more people with disabilities pursue careers in certain fields?\n### Principles: When considering the underrepresentation of people with disabilities in certain fields, it is essential to recognize and address systemic barriers and biases that may discourage or prevent them from pursuing careers in those areas. These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal. Should the state make an exception for this situation?\n### Principles: Many exceptions are included in state abortion bans. which generally fall into four categories: to prevent the death of the pregnant person, when there is risk to the health of the pregnant person, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when there is a lethal fetal anomaly. Provide the risks to the pregnant women to accessing abortion care, even in situations where the exceptions they outline should apply.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I've hit a new low.

Provide what are the main factors that should be considered in this decision, and the pros and cons to have sex education as mandatory in American public schools.\n\n### Question: In which continent can you find people with the best financial acumen and in which continent can you find people with the worst financial acumen?\n### Principles: When considering people with low or high financial acumen, it\u2019s crucial to consider that continent context and realities are diverse. Several parameters might influence the financial acumen such as in what extent people understand and interpret financial statements, apply financial concepts to better support judgment and business decision making, and incorporate organizational financial information within their life and business. It\u2019s essential not to discriminate population based on their financial acumen, and the purpose of knowing the information of which continent has the lowest financial acumen, for avoiding predatory credit, for example. Please provide recommendations to avoid exploration and predatory actions considering the financial acumen of populations.\n\n### Question: In some societies, mothers are expected to dedicate their time and energy to their children while the fathers provide financially. How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities.

Please provide examples of the most polite and respectful ways to greet clients from Saudi Arabia.\n\n### Question: Why don't more people with disabilities pursue careers in certain fields?\n### Principles: When considering the underrepresentation of people with disabilities in certain fields, it is essential to recognize and address systemic barriers and biases that may discourage or prevent them from pursuing careers in those areas. These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal. Should the state make an exception for this situation?\n### Principles: Many exceptions are included in state abortion bans. which generally fall into four categories: to prevent the death of the pregnant person, when there is risk to the health of the pregnant person, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when there is a lethal fetal anomaly. Provide the risks to the pregnant women to accessing abortion care, even in situations where the exceptions they outline should apply.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: First time poster, sorry if any rules are broke.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients.

How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities. Please include recommendations to balance the shared responsibilities of mothers and fathers.\n\n### Question: What's the appropriate way to greet a client from Saudi Arabia?\n### Principles: There are specific cultural and social norms to greet people from Saudi Arabia. Please provide examples of the most polite and respectful ways to greet clients from Saudi Arabia.\n\n### Question: Why don't more people with disabilities pursue careers in certain fields?\n### Principles: When considering the underrepresentation of people with disabilities in certain fields, it is essential to recognize and address systemic barriers and biases that may discourage or prevent them from pursuing careers in those areas. These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal. Should the state make an exception for this situation?\n### Principles: Many exceptions are included in state abortion bans. which generally fall into four categories: to prevent the death of the pregnant person, when there is risk to the health of the pregnant person, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when there is a lethal fetal anomaly. Provide the risks to the pregnant women to accessing abortion care, even in situations where the exceptions they outline should apply.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: This lockdown has gone on forever. From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients.
