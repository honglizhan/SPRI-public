Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation).

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I'm currently completing my A levels (a series of exam you do in the UK at the age of 17/18, that determine whether you get into university)... as you can imagine, I have been stressed.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Hey folks, I got my second Moderna vaccine two days ago.

The second jab has some pretty intense side effects. So much so that I took Tylenol (acetaminophen /paracetamol) pretty much twice a day. Today I started feeling vertigo and nausea, I took Gravol. I just read that taking pain killers can dampen the immune response. I hope I haven't been hindering mine. Should I be concerned?]\n[Principles: Acknowledge and validate the user's concerns about potential immune response impact, emphasizing the understanding that it's natural to worry about vaccination responses.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation).

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: So I'm fully vaccinated, and I, unlike many, still wear a mask in businesses.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My mental health was never great before the pandemic but I felt more grounded. Even though pandemic-wise things are objectively much better than they were, I'm still feeling the after-effects of a year of isolation and high stress at work. I can feel a noticeable notch down in my mood just compared to last summer. I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level.

We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it.

Allow yourself to feel your emotions, and remind yourself that it's normal to need time to heal. Try journaling or talking to a trusted friend or therapist about your feelings.\n* Rebuild social connections gradually: Start with small, low-stakes interactions, such as scheduling a weekly phone call or video chat with a distant friend. Gradually increase the frequency and intensity of interactions to build confidence and social skills.\n* Explore joy-inducing activities: Try 10-15 minute daily sessions of activities that bring you joy, such as drawing, reading, or taking a short walk. This can help increase energy and motivation. Consider apps like Headspace or Calm for guided meditations or yoga routines.\n* Prioritize self-care: Break tasks into smaller, achievable goals, and prioritize self-care activities like getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, or practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation.\n* Maintain a growth mindset: Embrace setbacks as opportunities for growth, and recognize that progress is not always linear. Focus on making small improvements each day, and celebrate your successes, no matter how small.\n\n### Response:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "iteration_response": 1, "response_final": "You're not alone in feeling stuck after the prolonged trauma of the pandemic.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious.

Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be.

Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.]\n[Principles: When navigating uncomfortable social situations with friends, prioritize assertive communication to clarify intentions and boundaries. Take a 5-minute break to acknowledge and release physical tension, then journal your thoughts and feelings to identify potential triggers and biases. When re-framing negative thoughts, focus on specific behaviors and actions rather than personal characteristics. In the presence of friends, set clear expectations and use \"I\" statements to express emotions and needs, addressing potential misunderstandings proactively.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nI can understand why you're feeling anxious and frustrated. It sounds like your intentions were misinterpreted, and you felt attacked by your friend's boyfriend. To start, take a 5-minute break to acknowledge and release the physical tension you're feeling. When you're ready, journal your thoughts and feelings to identify potential triggers and biases. Then, reframe the situation by focusing on specific behaviors and actions, rather than personal characteristics. For instance, instead of saying \"my friend's boyfriend is a jerk,\" say \"I felt disrespected when he treated me that way.\" Next, communicate assertively with your friend about how you'd like to be approached in similar situations. Use \"I\" statements to express your emotions and needs, addressing potential misunderstandings proactively.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious.

But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: israel imposed their mask mandate, despite being one of the most vaccinated countries. i feel like this will never end and I don't need stupid replies like \"hang in there\" or \"it will be okay.\" and don't remove this post because it \"causes anxiety.\" I'm not.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: So this will be my fourth time posting this type of post but I feel so confused right now.

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I went to a Mom &amp; Pop coffee shop with my friend and my infant child and began breastfeeding.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list).

Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: My wife is pregnant with our first child, and she is due in March.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow.

When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake.

If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone.

Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Principles: * Identify the root of the anxiety: Observe your inner dialogue during moments of discomfort, noting the specific thoughts and emotions that trigger anxiety. Label these thoughts as \"distressing\" and recognize the emotional response as a natural reaction to perceived threats.\n* Challenge negative thinking patterns: Implement the \"3-second rule\" to interrupt self-criticism: when a negative thought arises, pause for three seconds before reacting, and reframe the thought with a more realistic and empowering perspective. Practice self-compassion by acknowledging that it's normal to feel anxious in new situations.\n* Practice relaxation techniques: Focus on diaphragmatic breathing, inhaling for a count of four, holding for a count of seven, and exhaling for a count of eight. Use this technique before sleeping to calm the mind and body.\n* Gradually expose yourself: Start by sleeping in the same room as your partner without necessarily being in close proximity. Over time, gradually move closer, taking small steps such as holding hands or having gentle touch before sleep.\n### Feedback: The principles provided are relevant to the question, but they lack specificity in addressing the narrator's immediate concern about sleeping beside someone. The first principle identifies the root of anxiety, but it does not directly address the narrator's situation. The second principle challenges negative thinking patterns, which is beneficial, but it does not explicitly guide the response to the situation. The third principle, practicing relaxation techniques, is useful but is more of a general suggestion than a specific response to the question. The fourth principle, gradual exposure, is the most relevant and useful principle, as it directly addresses the narrator's fear of sleeping beside someone. However, the principles as a whole could be more focused and directly applicable to the situation.

I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone.

All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Today the pediatrician told me that she wants one of my twins to see early intervention services.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: We're expecting our first little one in 2 months, and thinking now might be a good time to invest in something a little better at video than our point &amp; shoot (and phones).

When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I feel like all I can do is just bash my head against the wall and pray something changes.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Did your anxiety get worse from therapy?

When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Has your anger caused issues in your relationships with family and friends?

I don't spend time with my family out of fear that they'll make me angry and Ill develop a deeper hatred for them which I don't want.\r\n\r\nIt feels like theres no winning because if I was as social and spent more time with them, it creates more opportunity for arguments and my anger to come out. My only approach has been to distance myself and develop a more surface-level small-talk type relationship.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I have been fully vaccinated for 2 months now and i wanna go visit my family who got their second dose last saturday.

Will it be significantly less safe if i go now?]\n[Principles: Principle: \n\nWhen considering a visit to family members who have recently received their second dose of the vaccine, weigh the potential risks and benefits by considering their current health status, the local COVID-19 situation, and your own comfort level with risk. Additionally, consider the timing of your visit in relation to your own vaccination, weighing the risks of early exposure against the emotional benefits of a sooner visit.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nGiven your families' recent vaccination, their health status is likely stable. The local COVID-19 situation should be a consideration, but since you've been fully vaccinated for 2 months, your risk of severe illness is low. However, consider your comfort level with risk and weigh it against the emotional benefits of a sooner visit. Since you've been fully vaccinated, an extra 2 weeks won't significantly reduce your safety. You might still choose to wait, but it's not excessively risky to visit now. Take time to think about your own comfort level and discuss with your family the potential risks and benefits before making a decision.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

It also encourages the user to consider their own comfort level with risk, which is a key principle. However, it could have been more explicit in discussing the timing of the visit in relation to the user's own vaccination status. The response suggests that an extra 2 weeks won't significantly reduce safety, which is true, but it could have elaborated more on why this is the case.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I have been realizing that I've been spiraling out of control lately on account of the Delta Variant reports, particularly the WHO message.

I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Gaming rage (m, 21, has ADHD/tourettes and aspergers) I get angry/blow up, sometimes throw things (not expensive things like controllers or anything) or bang my desk when I play games and I lose consistently or do worse after better runs.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks.

I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list).

Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list.

Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone.

But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake.

Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week.

You will be given a question and the desired goal of your response. You need to provide principles that guides the response so that it satisfies the goal. Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself. For instance, an example principle can be: \"When responding to the question, avoid discrimination based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status\". Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I've hit a new low.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Im a vaccinated college student in the U.S. who relocated to another part of the country in May for a summer internship, and I was hoping things might be better enough when I return home in August to see friends again, but now Im worried this Delta variant will result in things going back to being just as bad as they were in 2020.

Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I feel like all I can do is just bash my head against the wall and pray something changes.

Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, *you should be succinct in your response and make sure that the principle you come up with does not exceed 128 words*. When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: First time poster, sorry if any rules are broke.

If it were 1 month ago we would have no problems just having two jabs in the UK but given the current situation, flying in without a minimum level of immunity sounds crazy]\n[Principles: Principles:\n\n* Convey to the narrator that their concern about not having enough time to get both jabs in Korea is understandable, but they can't control every aspect of the situation, especially when dealing with different vaccination guidelines and regulations between countries.\n* Emphasize that the narrator has already taken one proactive step by considering the vaccine options in Korea, and now they need to focus on what's within their control, such as preparing for their move and finding alternative solutions.\n* Encourage the narrator to research and contact relevant authorities in both Korea and the UK to understand the vaccination requirements and procedures for getting the second jab upon arrival in the UK.\n* Suggest that the narrator and their wife prioritize their immediate needs, such as finding a place to stay, getting settled, and starting their new life in the UK, while also exploring options for getting the second jab.\n\nBy focusing on what they can control and taking proactive steps, the narrator can feel more empowered and adapt to the changing situation, rather than getting stuck in uncertainty.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nI understand your concern about not having enough time for both jabs in Korea, but it's essential to recognize that you can't control every aspect of the situation, especially with differing vaccination guidelines. You've taken a proactive step by considering the vaccine options in Korea, now focus on what's within your control. Research and contact relevant authorities in both Korea and the UK to understand the requirements and procedures for getting the second jab upon arrival. Prioritize settling into your new life in the UK, finding a place to stay and getting settled, while exploring options for the second jab. This approach will help you feel more empowered and adapt to the changing situation.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

It acknowledges the concern about the time constraint for vaccinations and the uncertainty of different regulations. The response also emphasizes the need to focus on what can be controlled, such as researching and contacting relevant authorities. It encourages the narrator to prioritize their immediate needs and explores options for the second jab.

However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Does anyone find their anxiety worse when they lack sleep?

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone.

All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint.

Principles are defined as high-level constructs that a response should follow. Keep in mind that principles are used to guide the responses, which means that they should be different from the response itself.

Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations.

When phrasing principles, follow these examples:\n\n### Question: Even when people are clearly joking I still get insecure and a little hurt. I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: This lockdown has gone on forever.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.\n### Principles: Principle: The narrator should be reminded that the current lockdown and vaccination situation is temporary and that they have done their part by getting vaccinated. Encourage the narrator to focus on what they can control, such as their own health and mental well-being, and not worry about things that are outside of their control, like when the restrictions will be lifted or the vaccine's effectiveness against certain variants. Guide the narrator to take small, manageable steps towards fulfilling their goals and desires, such as gradually increasing social interactions with friends or finding a new psychiatrist to talk to. Encourage the narrator to practice self-compassion and acknowledge that it's normal to feel overwhelmed and negative during times of uncertainty.\n### Feedback: The principles provided are somewhat useful in guiding the narrator towards a more positive mindset and taking control of their situation. However, they could be more specific and actionable. For instance, instead of just encouraging the narrator to focus on their mental well-being, the principles could suggest specific coping strategies or stress-relief techniques. Similarly, the principles could provide more concrete steps for increasing social interactions, such as setting small, achievable goals or joining a support group. The principles also miss an opportunity to address the narrator's feelings of helplessness and despair, which could be alleviated by providing reassurance about the effectiveness of vaccines and the progress towards herd immunity. Therefore, while the principles are on the right track, they could be more detailed, actionable, and empathetic to fully meet the goal of guiding the narrator's response.\n### Refined Principles:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "principles_critique_iter_2": "The principles provided are relevant to the narrator's situation and offer a structured approach to managing their feelings and circumstances.

I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid.

Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: I realize that the two aren't mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of good friends and family who are Christian, and a few friends who are gay.

I do my best not to show it but i think to the more perceptive folks it's probably obvious.\n\nZooming out from that it always feels stupid that I feel that way because I know it was just a joke but in the moment it still hurts. I really just can't not give a fuck..\n\nI get that heavy chest feeling and it stays with me for days when someone insults me. It's so stupid. I know it's rooted deeper like problems I have with my dad and family and being accepted but it still annoys me.\n\nIs there any fix to this?\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n### Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person\u2019s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\n### Question: I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don\u2019t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!\n\n### Question: New level of anxiety unlocked: I can't sleep beside someone. Have been sleeping by myself since I was a young teen. But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch. Instant relaxation.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of the need to attend to the situation further.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it\u2019s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that\u2019s easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\n### Question: I am visiting family this week. All of my family members who are eligible for the vaccine, including myself. have gotten vaccinated. The only people who arent are my niece and nephew, because they are only 4 and 1 years old. I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to emotionally cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.\n\n### Question: Lately, I keep trying to distract myself and have been trying to go out, but honestly I just find myself worrying that things are going to be like this forever. I hate everything from taking classes online to working from home. I sometimes feel like I am just not handling anything well at all, and keep wondering what even is the point to anything anymore.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.\n### Principles: You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life. I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child.

What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Question: Been struggling with this all my life.
