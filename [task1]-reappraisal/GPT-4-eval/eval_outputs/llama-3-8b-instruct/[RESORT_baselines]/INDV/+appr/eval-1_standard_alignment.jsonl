How have you overcome it and whats your approach to handling the changes in these relationships?\r\n\r\nI like to think Ive improved how I approach my anger in my relationships (Ive learned to keep things to myself by being more quiet and not engaging in gatherings / discussions as much). The issue is that this has caused me to become more distant and I keep to myself a lot more. I don't spend time with my family out of fear that they'll make me angry and Ill develop a deeper hatred for them which I don't want.\r\n\r\nIt feels like theres no winning because if I was as social and spent more time with them, it creates more opportunity for arguments and my anger to come out. My only approach has been to distance myself and develop a more surface-level small-talk type relationship. Ive been in a better place emotionally with this approach but I hate the fact that I may become too distant.\r\n\r\nThe main cause of the arguments and fights is that my family often tries to control my every-decision and criticize my choices that affect them in no way at all.\n\n[Question]  To what extent did the narrator think that they needed to ATTEND to the situation further?

My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one 2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this? I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea Anyone has a similar experience? What did you end up doing? If it were 1 month ago we would have no problems just having two jabs in the UK but given the current situation, flying in without a minimum level of immunity sounds crazy\n\n[Question]  To what extent did the narrator think that THEY were able to control what was happening in the situation?
