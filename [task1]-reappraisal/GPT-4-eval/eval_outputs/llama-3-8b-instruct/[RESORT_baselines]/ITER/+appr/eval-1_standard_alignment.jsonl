I'm under a tremendous amount of pressure to get very high grades (straight A's). I've completed 2 exams, and have 5 left to go, 3 of which I'll be sitting tomorrow, the next day, and the day after that...\n\nI'm shocked at how this stress has effected me physically. I've always been fairly neurotic, but the anxiety I tend to feel is transient, and is rarely severe enough to manifest in anything physically significant, beyond a raised pulse and slight breathlessness.\n\nI knew I was getting myself *way* too worked up when I started to pull out hair in the shower. I have very thick hair, so a lot of it was coming out. I've had severe brain fog, which hasn't been the least bit helpful during a time when I have to be the most alert and *with it*'. I've had no appetite, and now my trousers are all loose, with one  pair literally falling down when I walk. The most bizarre symptom I've had is this weird jaw tension - my jaw is very clicky, and it feels incredibly tense and stiff. As a hypochondriac, I was convinced this was a heart attack, but I was reassured that it's probably just anxiety. I've had weird gastrointestinal symptoms, where I feel nauseous, and have this pit in my stomach all of the time, which could be caused by the lack of eating, but it persists even when I have eaten. \n\nAnd then of course feelings of impending doom, etc etc. \n\nI just can't wait for this to be over.\n\n[Reappraisal Response] <Revised Reappraisal Response> Acknowledge that your stress is understandable given your A level pressure, but try not to let your anxiety dictate your experience. Recognize that your behaviors, such as hair pulling and lack of appetite, may be symptoms of your anxiety, but don't assume they define your academic abilities or worth. Instead, focus on what you can control, such as preparing thoroughly for your remaining exams, taking regular breaks, practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or yoga, and seeking support from friends, family or a counselor if needed. Given the level of pressure you're under, it's understandable to feel overwhelmed, but remember that it's within your control to manage your anxiety and take steps to move forward.\n[Feedback] <likert>5</likert><rationale>The narrator's personal values are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that they value academic achievement and success.

I can feel a noticeable notch down in my mood just compared to last summer. I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level.

It acknowledges their sense of control over seeking help, while also acknowledging the limitations of their situation and emphasizing the importance of small, incremental steps towards change. Here is the revised response:</rationale>\n\nI'm so sorry to hear that you're still struggling after the pandemic. It's understandable that you'd feel like you're not in control of your situation, especially with the loss of social connections and sense of community. It's great that you're aware of your ability to call your therapist in crisis, but it's also important to acknowledge that you can't control everything. Instead, focus on taking small steps towards progress, like breaking down tasks or giving yourself permission to take a break. Remember that you're doing the best you can, and being kind to yourself is just as important as trying to change.\n[Feedback] <likert>2</likert>\n<rationale>The narrator's personal values or ideals are not explicitly mentioned in the text, so it is difficult to determine the extent to which they align with the situation.

It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed.

Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking.

Granted, I did not have a cover (forgot it) but was sitting discretely and had a shirt on that hid most everything.\r\nA barista came over and asked that I use the Family Room (washroom with change table, microwave and lazy boy chair) to do feedings, as it was \"potentially unhygienic\" and \"other patrons may be uncomfortable.\" She also said that is what the room is designed for.\r\n\r\nSince this is an independent store, do they have the right to make this request?

While your family's behavior is concerning, you've also realized that your own anger has caused issues. Instead of solely focusing on their controlling behavior, acknowledge your own role in the distance between you and your family. Consider having open and honest conversations with your family about how their actions affect you, and at the same time, work on developing healthier communication patterns. Start small by engaging in small-talk and gradually build up to deeper conversations. Also, recognize that your self-imposed distance has its own emotional costs, and strive for a balance between expressing yourself honestly and nurturing your relationships with your family.\n\nNote: The revised reappraisal response acknowledges the narrator's feedback about feeling stuck between being social and potentially arguing, or being distant but still having emotional well-being.

{"Reddit ID": "o8ejot", "Reddit Post": "I have been realizing that I've been spiraling out of control lately on account of the Delta Variant reports, particularly the WHO message. As of right now we have not been seeing many case increases here in the US. The occasional rise, but so far it hasn't been huge. That's why I feel I should take time off from looking at the updates of teh Delta Variant. The fact that we are still making progress with vaccination should remind myself that we are still on the path to beating the pandemic and that these restrictions are soon going to be gone.

Recognizing this incident as a slip-up acknowledges that you're human, and it's normal to struggle with impulse management. However, it's essential to acknowledge the fear you're feeling and the uncertainty surrounding your future ability to control your temper. To address this, take immediate action towards improving anger management skills, such as by:\n\n* Seeking professional help to develop coping strategies\n* Practicing deep breathing, meditation, or other relaxation techniques\n* Identifying and avoiding triggers that can lead to outbursts\n* Building a support network to help you stay accountable and motivated\n\nRemember, it's the taking of that first step that matters most. Your desire to apologize to your mom and make amends demonstrates your willingness to take responsibility for your actions and work towards personal growth. Focus on making tangible progress towards managing your anger, and you'll be more likely to regain the trust and respect of those around you.\n[Feedback] <likert>5</likert><rationale>The narrator seems to have insight into their emotions and the consequences of their actions, acknowledging their fear of hurting someone in the future and wishing to be a better person.

It acknowledges the narrator's concern and validates their feelings, which is important in a reappraisal response. It also reminds the narrator of the control they have over their actions, such as staying informed and following guidelines. The response could have been more specific in terms of suggesting ways to control the situation, such as seeking help from others or taking a mental break. However, it does suggest taking things one step at a time, which is a form of controlling the situation. Overall, the response aligns well with the standards, hence the score of 8.</rationale>"}

They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.\n\n[Reappraisal Response] You're not alone in feeling frustrated and helpless. The situation is complex, and there's no clear timeline for restrictions to be lifted. Instead of internalizing responsibility for the situation, focus on what you can control: your own well-being and actions. Continue to prioritize vaccination efforts and support those trying to make a difference. Allow yourself to lean on others when needed, and explore online resources or support groups for mental health concerns. Remember that you're not responsible for the situation, but you can take small steps towards feeling more in control and connected.\n[Feedback] <likert>2</likert><rationale>The narrator feels overwhelmed and unable to cope with the prolonged lockdown and constant uncertainty.

It acknowledges the narrator's struggle and frustration, and emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and the desire to change. It also suggests exploring new ways to manage emotions and develop healthier habits. However, it could have done a better job in addressing the potential conflicts of internal values that may arise in such situations, and the importance of re-appraising the situation from others\u2019 perspectives. Therefore, I rate this response an 8 out of 10.</rationale>"}
