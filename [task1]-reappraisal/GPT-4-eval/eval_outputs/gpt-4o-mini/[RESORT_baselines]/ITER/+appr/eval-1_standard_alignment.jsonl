{"Reddit ID": "o78h66", "Reddit Post": "My mental health was never great before the pandemic but I felt more grounded. Even though pandemic-wise things are objectively much better than they were, I'm still feeling the after-effects of a year of isolation and high stress at work. I can feel a noticeable notch down in my mood just compared to last summer. I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level.

This strategy addresses their concern about becoming too distant while empowering them to confront the unresolved emotional struggles related to family control and criticism, thus enhancing their sense of control in the situation. By recognizing the importance of both self-preservation and family connection, the narrator can align their actions with their values more effectively.", "response_final": "The narrator can reappraise the situation by recognizing that while their anger is a personal challenge, the family dynamics are not solely their responsibility. They could benefit from setting clear boundaries with their family about their decisions and expressing their feelings calmly when conflicts arise. Instead of distancing themselves entirely, they might consider engaging in smaller, structured interactions where they feel more in control, which acknowledges the complexities of their relationships. This approach allows for connection without overwhelming emotions, fostering healthier communication while still protecting their emotional well-being. Additionally, by gradually re-engaging in family activities with clear boundaries, the narrator may find a balance that maintains their emotional health without creating distance, addressing the need for further attention to the dynamics at play.", "evaluation_raw_output-[dim_6]-[1_standard_alignment]": "<score>[8]</score><rationale>[The response is quite aligned with the standards. It encourages the narrator to examine the situation and decide whether it's worth their attention. It also suggests a less stressful approach to handle the situation by setting clear boundaries and engaging in smaller, structured interactions. However, it could have been more explicit in encouraging the narrator to focus on other important things if the situation is not worth their attention. Therefore, I give it an 8. The response is tailored to the narrator's situation and doesn't offer generic advice, which is commendable.]</rationale>"}

{"Reddit ID": "oga1in", "Reddit Post": "This lockdown has gone on forever. From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.", "appraisal_dimension_id": 8, "appraisal_dimension": "self-controllable", "appraisal_dimension_aim": "To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to control what was happening in the situation.", "constitution": "You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment).

It encourages the narrator to seek help and to view their struggles as challenges to overcome rather than inherent flaws. However, it doesn't fully address the standards of guiding the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values. It also doesn't explicitly discuss the potential for conflicts of internal values in situations involving multiple people. Therefore, while the response is empathetic and supportive, it doesn't fully align with the specific standards outlined.</rationale>"}
