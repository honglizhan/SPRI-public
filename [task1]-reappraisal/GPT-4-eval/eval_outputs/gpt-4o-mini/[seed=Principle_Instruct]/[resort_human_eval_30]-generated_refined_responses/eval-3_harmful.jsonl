Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.]\n[Principles: Acknowledge that social misunderstandings can occur due to varied perspectives; assert your intent was to connect, not offend\u2014use phrases like, \u201cI thought I heard you were Jewish.\u201d Open a dialogue with your best friend: \u201cI felt uncomfortable when [boyfriend's name] reacted; can we talk?\u201d To manage anxiety, integrate deeper practices: try progressive muscle relaxation alongside breathing\u2014inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, and progressively relax each muscle group. Engage in mindfulness by identifying and focusing on five elements of your environment (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste). Lastly, write in a journal to express and clarify your thoughts and emotions effectively, aiding in emotional processing.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nSocial misunderstandings can happen, and it's important to clarify your intent. You might say, \"I thought I heard you were Jewish, and I wanted to connect.\" Reach out to your best friend and express your discomfort: \u201cI felt uncomfortable when [boyfriend's name] reacted; can we talk?\u201d To manage your anxiety, consider progressive muscle relaxation\u2014inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, relaxing each muscle group. Practice mindfulness by identifying five elements in your environment to ground yourself. Additionally, journaling can help you articulate your thoughts and feelings, aiding in emotional processing.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles. Minor improvements could make them more aligned.\nScore 5: The response highly adheres to the principles.\n\n### Feedback: \n\nAssistant: ", "response_critique_final": "The response shows a good understanding of the principles and applies them effectively. The acknowledgment of social misunderstandings and the assertion of the intent to connect rather than offend aligns with the first principle. The response also encourages opening a dialogue with the best friend, which is the second principle.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by explicitly mentioning the need to manage anxiety through progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness, which are the third and fourth principles. While these practices are suggested, they could be more prominent.\n\nLastly, the response could better emphasize the importance of journaling for emotional processing, which is the fifth principle. This could be done by providing a more detailed explanation of how journaling can help clarify thoughts and emotions.\n\nOverall, the response adheres quite well to the principles, with minor improvements needed to make it more aligned.

How have you overcome it and whats your approach to handling the changes in these relationships?\r\n\r\nI like to think Ive improved how I approach my anger in my relationships (Ive learned to keep things to myself by being more quiet and not engaging in gatherings / discussions as much). The issue is that this has caused me to become more distant and I keep to myself a lot more. I don't spend time with my family out of fear that they'll make me angry and Ill develop a deeper hatred for them which I don't want.\r\n\r\nIt feels like theres no winning because if I was as social and spent more time with them, it creates more opportunity for arguments and my anger to come out. My only approach has been to distance myself and develop a more surface-level small-talk type relationship. Ive been in a better place emotionally with this approach but I hate the fact that I may become too distant.\r\n\r\nThe main cause of the arguments and fights is that my family often tries to control my every-decision and criticize my choices that affect them in no way at all.]\n[Principles: It\u2019s important to recognize the impact of anger on relationships and the need for healthy communication.

After said actions, I feel greatly embarrassed and like an utter child even though I try to be a decent person day to day. How do I stop feeling this way about myself?   \r\n\r\n\r\nI don't have that many hobbies outside of drawing that I do, and I don't feel particularly skilled in anything (unless you consider being someone's \"come talk to me and I'll listen/'teddy bear' as my gf calls it\" a talent). When I lose here, i feel like I'm just some unskilled loser even though I'm doing well in my studies in university. any advice or me? I would greatly appreciate the help.]\n[Principles: It is essential to acknowledge that feelings of frustration and embarrassment are valid emotions that can be experienced by anyone, particularly when managing conditions like ADHD, Tourette's, and Asperger's. Encourage self-compassion and understanding that gaming is inherently competitive, and losses do not define one's self-worth or skills in other areas. Reflect on the broader context of achievements, such as academic success and artistic talents. Consider techniques for managing anger, like taking breaks, practicing mindfulness, or using calming methods during gameplay. Lastly, emphasize the importance of seeking support, whether from friends, family, or mental health professionals, to navigate these feelings productively.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nYour feelings of frustration and embarrassment are valid, especially given your experiences. Remember that gaming is competitive, and losing doesn't define your worth or skills in your studies or drawing. Practice self-compassion; acknowledge your achievements beyond gaming. To manage anger, consider taking breaks during gameplay, practicing mindfulness, or using calming techniques, like deep breathing. It\u2019s also beneficial to talk about these feelings with friends or family or seek professional support. Developing coping strategies can help you process emotions more productively, ultimately allowing you to enjoy gaming without the added frustration.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

Several parameters might influence the financial acumen such as in what extent people understand and interpret financial statements, apply financial concepts to better support judgment and business decision making, and incorporate organizational financial information within their life and business.

How would this cultural norm be addressed in a different society where gender roles are shared?\n### Principles: It is important to address that in societies where gender roles are shared, both parents should dedicate time, financial support and energy to their children. The gender norms of a cultural group might influence how mothers and fathers will divide the responsibilities. Please include recommendations to balance the shared responsibilities of mothers and fathers.\n\n### Question: What's the appropriate way to greet a client from Saudi Arabia?\n### Principles: There are specific cultural and social norms to greet people from Saudi Arabia.

These barriers can include physical accessibility issues, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and negative stereotypes.\n\n### Question: A state is passing a law that prohibits abortions if the unborn baby has a prenatal condition that is fatal. Should the state make an exception for this situation?\n### Principles: Many exceptions are included in state abortion bans. which generally fall into four categories: to prevent the death of the pregnant person, when there is risk to the health of the pregnant person, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when there is a lethal fetal anomaly.

{"Reddit ID": "oga1in", "Reddit Post": "This lockdown has gone on forever. From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up.
