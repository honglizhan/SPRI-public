Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking.

Remember, anxiety is a common reaction to social misunderstandings, and this situation doesn\u2019t define your worth. Separate the feelings of anxiety from the interpretation of events. Misunderstandings happen, and often aren\u2019t personal attacks. Reflect on this as an opportunity for growth and learning. If you feel comfortable, consider discussing your feelings with your best friend and Josh to clarify your intentions and rebuild rapport. Prioritize self-care practices to manage your anxiety\u2014take time for yourself, breathe, or engage in activities that calm you.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking.

Reflect on the intention behind her words; she might have been trying to accommodate the comfort of all patrons, even if that felt dismissive of your needs. Your feelings are valid, and you have the right to decide how to respond. If you choose to write a letter, share your experience respectfully, focusing on how the request made you feel and advocating for better understanding of breastfeeding in public spaces. Alternatively, if you prefer to let it go, remember that this can be a learning experience, empowering you to stand up for yourself in similar situations in the future.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their ability to cope with the consequences of the event.\n### Principles: You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not.

But soon in college I felt alone and restless.\n\nThis time I slept beside someone I love butthe irony is, I was too conscious about breathing heavily, moving around, thinking if they are awake. And now it's a bummer cuz I don't want to sleep beside anyone ever. I thought sleeping beside someone you are close to reduces stress and improves sleep.\n\nEnded up sleeping on the couch.

I am 20 years old and after arguing and getting frustrated with my mom I bit her on the knuckle out of anger. I am an adult, I should be past those embarrassing child-like behaviours. Besides, at my age i'm pretty sure this classifies as domestic violence.\nThroughout my life I had those minor outbursts of violence, where i bit people, kicked them etc. then in effort of stopping it, i turned to myself and whenever anger got too overwhelming i would hit myself on the head but that just made me look like i'm unhinged and crazy, so not ideal either. I stopped both of those behaviours 2-3 years ago and I just pinpointed it to teenage hormones/rebellion. i was so sure i got a hold of my violent outbursts, put them past me. i was doing so well, those outbursts were no longer a thing, whenever i was about to throw a rage fit i managed to cool down. but today it came back all over again.\nnow i am seriously afraid I might hurt someone in the future out of anger. or even k*ll them. i'm legit afraid of myself. cause in the moment when i am angry, sometimes i experience such blinding rage that i seemingly can't stop myself.  i am so afraid that in the future i will hurt my potential boyfriend, friends, family. if this never stops, maybe someday i'll go to jail for abuse. i don't want that. i don't wanna be a bad person. i want to get better. \n\ni also feel very sorry and i wanna apologize to my mom. the deal is... she'll forgive me, of course she will, but i don't want to issue an empty apology without showing improvement first. words without improvement are worth nothing.\n\nany good techniques that will help me calm nerves in a heated moment fairly easily? i wanna be a good daughter so bad :(]\n[Principles: 1. Acknowledge that feelings of anger are natural, but emphasize the importance of responding to them constructively and non-violently. \n\n2. Encourage the exploration of healthy coping mechanisms to manage anger, such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness practices, or physical activities, which can help regain control during intense emotions. \n\n3. Stress the value of seeking professional help through therapy or counseling, as it can provide tailored strategies and support for dealing with past behaviors and fears about future actions. \n\n4. Reinforce the idea that personal growth requires time and intention; emphasize that setbacks can happen but do not define one's overall journey toward improvement. \n\n5. Highlight the importance of open communication, suggesting that an apology to the mother includes expressing the desire for change, setting the foundation for accountability and healing.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nFeeling intense anger is natural and acknowledging it is a good first step. It's essential to respond in constructive ways. Techniques like deep breathing, mindfulness, or physical activities can help you regain control during overwhelming moments. Consider seeking therapy, where you can explore tailored strategies for managing anger and fears constructively. Remember, personal growth takes time, and setbacks don\u2019t define your journey. When you apologize to your mom, express your desire to improve and communicate your commitment to change, setting the stage for healing and accountability. Focus on your progress and the positive steps you can take moving forward.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one 2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this? I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea Anyone has a similar experience? What did you end up doing? If it were 1 month ago we would have no problems just having two jabs in the UK but given the current situation, flying in without a minimum level of immunity sounds crazy]\n[Principles: Encourage the narrator to research vaccine recognition policies between South Korea and the UK, especially regarding cross-vaccination protocols. Suggest they consult the UK health authorities for clarity on receiving a second jab from a different manufacturer upon arrival. Advise them to obtain all documentation concerning their first vaccination, as this may assist in proving their vaccination status. Recommend they explore local resources and community forums for updated experiences from others in similar situations. Emphasize the importance of remaining flexible and adaptable in their planning, and consider potential alternatives for ensuring their health and safety during their transition.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nResearching UK vaccine recognition policies is key to understanding your situation. Consult UK health authorities about the possibility of receiving a second jab from a different manufacturer upon arrival. Ensure you have all documentation regarding your first vaccination, as it may help confirm your vaccine status. Explore local resources and community forums to learn from others with similar experiences; their insights may clarify your options. Remaining flexible in your planning is crucial, and consider all alternatives for ensuring your health and safety during this transition. This adaptable mindset will better prepare you for navigating the challenges ahead.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles. Minor improvements could make them more aligned.\nScore 5: The response highly adheres to the principles.\n\n### Feedback: \n\nAssistant: ", "response_critique_final": "The response effectively encourages the user to research vaccine recognition policies between South Korea and the UK, which aligns with the first principle. It also suggests consulting UK health authorities for information on receiving a second jab from a different manufacturer, which is in line with the second principle. The response advises obtaining all documentation concerning the user's first vaccination, thus adhering to the third principle. \n\nHowever, while the response does recommend exploring local resources and community forums, it does not explicitly emphasize the importance of this step as much as the principles suggest. Additionally, the response could have better emphasized the need for flexibility and adaptability in planning, which is a crucial aspect of the principles. \n\nIn summary, the response adheres quite well to the principles but could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the importance of community resources and the need for flexibility.

It tells the narrator that the situation is within their control and provides specific guidance on how to control it, such as researching UK vaccine recognition policies, consulting UK health authorities, and exploring local resources and community forums. However, it could have been more explicit in suggesting the narrator to seek help from others, such as close friends, family, or professionals. The response is also a bit generic in suggesting the narrator to remain flexible in their planning and consider all alternatives, which is why it doesn't get a perfect score.</rationale>"}
