I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them.

We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level.

I wanted to see an old friend from high school, but I found out that this friend did not get vaccinated. My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced? I know this is a stupid question, but Im curious what you all would do.\n\n[Reappraisal Response]  Protecting vulnerable family members is essential, especially when they can't get vaccinated. By respecting your brother's wishes and maintaining virtual connections with unvaccinated friends, you ensure safety and consideration for everyone involved.\n[Feedback] Please revise the reappraisal response to help the narrator reappraise the situation better.

It also encourages the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions by suggesting a compromise that could potentially satisfy both parties. However, it could have done a better job of encouraging the narrator to control their negative feelings and avoid situations that trigger such negative emotions.

[/INST]</s> [INST] [Text] I realize that the two aren't mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of good friends and family who are Christian, and a few friends who are gay. I don't really have anything against either group. It's just that I'd find it much easier being supportive of a gay son than a Christian son. I'm straight, but I can understand being in love, and I think I could deal with the first time my son brings home a boyfriend if he turns out to be gay. As an atheist, though, I can't understand believing in God, and I think if he turns out to be Christian, it would be hard for me to be supportive. He'd have more community support as a Christian, but I feel like it would be harder to connect with him myself.\r\n\r\nIs this selfish?\n\n[Reappraisal Response]  Embrace understanding and open-mindedness towards your child, whatever their sexual or spiritual journey.
