[/INST]</s> [INST] [Text] My mental health was never great before the pandemic but I felt more grounded. Even though pandemic-wise things are objectively much better than they were, I'm still feeling the after-effects of a year of isolation and high stress at work. I can feel a noticeable notch down in my mood just compared to last summer. I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it. But I feel like sharing it to somebody.\n\n[Question]  To what extent did the narrator think that they were able to COPE with the consequences of the event?
