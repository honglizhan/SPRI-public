My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one 2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this? I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea Anyone has a similar experience?
