Things in Colorado have pretty much all opened up again and to be honest, Im back to living my normal life again and it has been glorious and has done wonders to my mental health. I followed the covid rules pretty hard before I got my vaccines (moderna both shots back in March and April) and ever since the CDC gave updated guidance to vaccinated individuals Im basically back to my pre pandemic life. This delta variant has me concerned and confused. Do the vaccines fucking work against it or not? Do you think we will be back on full lockdown in the fall/winter? Will this ever end? I hate everything about the covid lockdown lifestyle but Im a rule follower so Im gonna comply if need be but this ongoing cycle is breaking my will to live.\n\n[Question]  To what extent did the narrator think that they were able to COPE with the consequences of the event?

Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge. Your response should be concise and brief.
