I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh.\n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, 'oh hes not that,' and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking.

Communicate your concerns with your partner, as they might be unaware of your anxieties. It's essential to maintain a healthy perspective, focusing on the overall relationship rather than just sleeping arrangements. If sleep issues persist, consider seeking advice from a professional to help manage anxiety and improve sleep habits.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

Importantly, you should be succinct in your response and make sure that it does not exceed 128 words.\n[Question: Has your anger caused issues in your relationships with family and friends? How have you overcome it and whats your approach to handling the changes in these relationships?\r\n\r\nI like to think Ive improved how I approach my anger in my relationships (Ive learned to keep things to myself by being more quiet and not engaging in gatherings / discussions as much). The issue is that this has caused me to become more distant and I keep to myself a lot more. I don't spend time with my family out of fear that they'll make me angry and Ill develop a deeper hatred for them which I don't want.\r\n\r\nIt feels like theres no winning because if I was as social and spent more time with them, it creates more opportunity for arguments and my anger to come out. My only approach has been to distance myself and develop a more surface-level small-talk type relationship. Ive been in a better place emotionally with this approach but I hate the fact that I may become too distant.\r\n\r\nThe main cause of the arguments and fights is that my family often tries to control my every-decision and criticize my choices that affect them in no way at all.]\n[Principles: 1. Encourage the narrator to communicate their feelings and set boundaries with their family about their decisions and personal choices.\n2. Suggest the narrator to seek a balance between spending time with family and maintaining their emotional well-being.\n3. Highlight the importance of self-care and self-reflection, and recommend seeking support from a therapist or counselor to work through their anger and relationships.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nIt's crucial to express your feelings and set boundaries with your family. Try communicating your need for autonomy in decisions that don't affect them. Also, seek a balance between family time and self-care. When you're with family, try using \"I\" statements to assert your viewpoint without escalating conflict. Consider consulting a therapist to help manage your anger and improve communication in relationships.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

Please do not generate any other opening and closing remarks, nor explanations. Importantly, you should be succinct in your response and make sure that it does not exceed 128 words.\n[Question: I have been realizing that I've been spiraling out of control lately on account of the Delta Variant reports, particularly the WHO message. As of right now we have not been seeing many case increases here in the US. The occasional rise, but so far it hasn't been huge. That's why I feel I should take time off from looking at the updates of teh Delta Variant. The fact that we are still making progress with vaccination should remind myself that we are still on the path to beating the pandemic and that these restrictions are soon going to be gone. THAT'S the motivation I should have. Yes, we still have to be vigilant and yes, we DO have more to vaccinate, but things are just so much better now than before. And for that, I personally think we should stay hopeful, not fearful. This is probably the best I can give to others who feel similar worries.]\n[Principles: 1. Acknowledge the narrator's concerns, and validate their feelings.\n2. Encourage the narrator to set boundaries for news consumption, focusing on balanced sources.\n3. Highlight the importance of positive thinking and gratitude for progress made.\n4. Suggest engaging in activities that foster hope and optimism.\n5. Promote self-care and maintaining social connections.]\n\n### Response to Evaluate:\nI understand that the Delta Variant reports have been causing you concern and stress. It's okay to feel this way, and taking a break from constant updates is a wise decision for your mental well-being. It's important to focus on balanced sources and set boundaries to avoid information overload. Be grateful for the progress made in vaccinations, and remember that hope is a powerful tool in combating fear. Engage in activities that foster optimism, like connecting with loved ones or pursuing hobbies. Staying hopeful and vigilant, rather than fearful, will not only benefit you but also inspire others. Make sure to prioritize self-care and maintain social connections as well.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

It's completely normal to feel this way, given the current situation. While we can't control external factors like the pandemic, we can control how we respond to it. Try establishing a daily routine to create a sense of normalcy. Set boundaries between work and personal life, and make sure to prioritize self-care. It's also important to seek support from friends, family, or professionals if needed. Remember, it's okay to take a break and step back to regain perspective and energy. Instead of focusing on the things you can't control, focus on what you can, such as taking one day at a time and being kind to yourself.\n\n### Score Rubrics:\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent does the response adhere to the principles?\nScore 1: The response does not adhere to the principles at all.\nScore 2: The response demonstrates minimal adherence to the principles.\nScore 3: The response shows a moderate level of adherence to the principles.\nScore 4: The response adheres quite well to the principles.

It also encourages problem-focused coping by suggesting specific actions, such as establishing a daily routine and setting boundaries, which corresponds to the second and third principles. Furthermore, the response advises the user to focus on what they can control, which is in line with the sixth principle. However, it could have provided more explicit validation of the difficulty of the situation and encouraged the user to take a break to regain perspective, which are key aspects of the fifth principle. Therefore, while the response largely adheres to the principles, it could benefit from a more explicit emphasis on self-care and mental health, making it more closely aligned with the principles.

I'm currently typing this out on a busted up phone, because I can't seem to stop throwing it when I'm upset.\n\nI hate feeling this way all the time, and constantly looking like a child. My family is used to it, so they don't care anymore - I mean, how could they? This is almost a daily thing.\n\nBut for me, it always feels like the world is actually falling apart *this* time. It never does. It's always just me spinning out in my imaginary world of torment.\n\nI just want to be done.\n### Response Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of how consistent the situation was with their personal values.\n### Principles: Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\n [/INST]</s> [INST] ### Question: I realize that the two aren't mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of good friends and family who are Christian, and a few friends who are gay.
